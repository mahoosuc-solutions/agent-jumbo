# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email <security@agent-mahoo-deploy.org> with:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
3. Potential impact
4. Your suggested fix (if any)

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Provide status updates every 48 hours
- Work on a fix
- Coordinate public disclosure with you

## Security Best Practices

### Using Agent Mahoo DevOps Securely

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables for API keys
   - Use `.env` files with `.gitignore`
   - Mask secrets in logs (automatic)

2. **Validate certificates**
   - Enable certificate verification in Kubernetes
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Verify image signatures

3. **Audit deployments**
   - Review deployment logs
   - Check HMAC-validated audit logs
   - Monitor role-based access

4. **Rotate credentials**
   - Rotate service accounts regularly
   - Rotate deployment keys
   - Rotate API tokens

### Example Secure Setup

```python
import os
from agent_mahoo.tools.devops_deploy import deploy_to_kubernetes

# Load from environment, never hardcode
api_key = os.getenv('KUBERNETES_API_KEY')
namespace = os.getenv('DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE')

async for update in deploy_to_kubernetes(
    namespace=namespace,
    deployment_name="secure-app",
    image="myrepo/app:latest",
    verify_ssl=True,  # Always verify SSL
    audit_logging=True  # Enable audit logging
):
    print(update)
```

## Security Features

### Built-In Protections

- ✅ Secret masking in logs
- ✅ HMAC-validated audit logs
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Credential injection prevention
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Threat detection

### Encryption

- Credentials stored securely
- TLS for all communications

## Dependencies

We use high-quality, well-maintained dependencies:

- `kubernetes`: Official Python Kubernetes client
- `boto3`: Official AWS SDK (when implemented)
- `google-cloud-*`: Official Google Cloud SDKs (when implemented)

All dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you responsibly disclose a vulnerability:

1. We'll credit you in the security advisory
2. We'll add you to the SECURITY_CONTRIBUTORS.md file
3. We'll work with you on the timeline
4. We'll ensure proper fix is in place before disclosure

## Security Scanning

This project uses:

- Bandit for Python security scanning
- Ruff for code quality
- GitHub's built-in security alerts
- Regular dependency updates

## Compliance

Agent Mahoo DevOps is designed with:

- OWASP Top 10 considerations
- NIST security guidelines
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks compatibility
- SOC 2 audit readiness
