## Troubleshooting

**"Low health score"**
→ Focus on 1 metric at a time, run revenue scan

**"Low efficiency"**
→ Eliminate distractions, block focus time, automate routine tasks

**"Low balance score"**
→ Delegate/automate to reduce hours, set boundaries, prioritize health

**"No automation opportunities found"**
→ Review task list manually, track time for 1 week, re-run

**"Diagram not rendering"**
→ Check .mmd file syntax, verify mermaid.js loaded, try PNG export

## Best Practices

1. **Track Trends** - Save reports monthly, compare scores
2. **Set Goals** - Target +10 points per quarter
3. **Act Fast** - Implement top 3 within 30 days
4. **Measure Impact** - Re-run after changes
5. **Share Results** - Export diagrams for stakeholders
6. **Stay Consistent** - Monthly comprehensive, weekly balance
7. **Use Real Data** - Actual numbers > estimates
