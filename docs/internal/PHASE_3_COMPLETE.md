## EventBus Integration

### Event System Architecture

All three AI agents integrated with event-driven architecture:

- **Research Events**: `research.started`, `findings.discovered`
- **Writer Events**: `content.generated`, `writing.requested`
- **Operations Events**: `task.started`, `task.completed`

### Cross-Agent Communication

- Research → Writer: Research findings trigger content generation
- Writer → Operations: Generated content triggers task execution
- Operations → Research: Task execution can request additional research
- EventBus coordination enables autonomous multi-agent workflows

### Life Automation Integration

- Calendar context: Events accessible to all agents
- Finance context: Transaction data available for content/analysis
- Past history: Learning from previous operations

## Implementation Methodology

### TDD Swarm Approach

Each team followed the proven pattern from Phases 1-2:

2. **GREEN Phase**: Implemented all test cases with working code
3. **REFACTOR**: Optimized performance and code quality

### Batch Implementation Strategy

- Used Python scripts for efficient test implementation
- Replaced pytest.skip() statements with working test code
- Index-based mapping ensured correct test implementations
- All teams achieved 100% passing rate in first implementation

### Quality Assurance

- Comprehensive error handling for each capability
- Performance validation with target thresholds
- EventBus integration verified across all agents
- Cross-team coordination testing
