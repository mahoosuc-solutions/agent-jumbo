## 🎯 The TDD Approach (Red → Green → Refactor)

### Phase 1: RED (Tests Fail)

```text
Team writes test specification
↓
pytest runs test
↓
Test fails (not yet implemented)
```

### Phase 2: GREEN (Tests Pass)

```text
Team implements minimal code to pass test
↓
pytest runs test
↓
Test passes ✓
```

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Clean Up)

```text
Team refactors code for quality
↓
Tests still pass
↓
Coverage improves
```

### Example: Calendar Sync

**RED Phase**:

```python
def test_create_event_from_reservation(self):
    """Test creating calendar event from PMS reservation"""
    pytest.skip("Implementation pending - Team A to implement")

# Run: pytest test_pms_calendar_sync.py::test_create_event_from_reservation -v
# Result: SKIPPED
```

**GREEN Phase**:

```python
def test_create_event_from_reservation(self):
    """Test creating calendar event from PMS reservation"""
    # No more skip - actual test
    sync = CalendarSyncService()
    event = sync.sync_reservation_to_calendar(sample_reservation)
    assert event is not None

# Run: pytest test_pms_calendar_sync.py::test_create_event_from_reservation -v
# Result: PASSED ✓
```

**REFACTOR Phase**:

```python
def test_create_event_from_reservation(self):
    """Test creating calendar event from PMS reservation"""
    sync = CalendarSyncService()

    # More complete test
    event = sync.sync_reservation_to_calendar(sample_reservation)
    assert event.title == f"Reservation {sample_reservation.guest_name}"
    assert event.start == sample_reservation.check_in_date
    assert event.end == sample_reservation.check_out_date
    assert event.description is not None
    assert len(event.description) > 0

# Run: pytest test_pms_calendar_sync.py::test_create_event_from_reservation -v
# Result: PASSED ✓ (100% coverage for this test)
```

## 🔗 Integration Points (Both Teams Must Understand)

### EventBus Integration

```python
# Teams will subscribe to these events:
event_bus.subscribe("pms.reservation.created", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.reservation.updated", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.reservation.cancelled", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.reservation.checked_in", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.reservation.checked_out", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.issue.reported", callback)
event_bus.subscribe("pms.pricing_rule.updated", callback)
```

### Canonical Models (Read-Only, Do Not Modify)

```python
from instruments.custom.pms_hub.canonical_models import (
    Property, Unit, Guest, Reservation, Message, Review, Calendar, PricingRule
)
```

### Provider Registry (Existing Service)

```python
from instruments.custom.pms_hub.provider_registry import ProviderRegistry

registry = ProviderRegistry()
provider = await registry.get_provider_async("provider_id")
```

### Calendar Hub Tool (Team A Will Use)

```python
from instruments.custom.calendar_hub.calendar_manager import CalendarHubManager

manager = CalendarHubManager(db_path)
manager.create_event(calendar_id, title, start, end, attendees, notes)
```
