```

---

## 🧪 TDD Cycle Demonstrated

### Phase 1: RED (Tests Fail)

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
def test_calendar_sync_service_creation(self):
    """Test creating calendar sync service"""
    pytest.skip("Implementation pending")
```

❌ Test skipped/failed - no implementation

### Phase 2: GREEN (Tests Pass)

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
def test_calendar_sync_service_creation(self):
    from instruments.custom.pms_hub.calendar_sync import CalendarSyncService

    service = CalendarSyncService()
    assert service is not None
    assert hasattr(service, "registry")
    assert hasattr(service, "event_bus")
```

✅ Test passes - minimal implementation complete

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Clean Code)

```python
# Implementation refined to handle edge cases:
# - EventBus initialization with proper event store
# - Calendar Hub manager graceful degradation
# - Error handling with context preservation
# - Proper exception handling in sync operations
```

✅ Code quality improved while maintaining passing tests

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Implementation

### ★ Architecture Insight ──────────────────────────────────

1. **EventBus Pattern**: Requires event store initialization for event persistence - useful for audit trails
2. **Service Initialization**: Graceful degradation when optional services unavailable (Calendar Hub, EventBus)
3. **Data Formatting**: Calendar events need comprehensive description fields including all reservation details
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

### ★ Implementation Insight ──────────────────────────────────

1. **Attribute Handling**: Use `getattr()` with defaults for optional model attributes
2. **Error Messages**: Preserve detailed error context in exception handling for debugging
3. **Async Patterns**: Proper use of async/await for I/O operations (calendar API calls)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

### ★ Testing Insight ──────────────────────────────────────

1. **Mock Strategy**: Use `patch.object()` for service dependencies
2. **Fixture Reuse**: Leverage conftest.py fixtures (sample_reservation) across test classes
3. **Test Organization**: Clear test class hierarchy matching feature domains
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

## 📋 Team A: Calendar Hub Integration - Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Continue This Approach)

1. **Implement TestCalendarEventUpdates (4 tests)**

   ```python
   # Location: test_pms_calendar_sync.py:153
   # Tests for updating events when status/dates change
   # Estimated: 1 hour
   ```

2. **Implement TestBlockedDatesSync (5 tests)**

   ```python
   # Location: test_pms_calendar_sync.py:170
   # Tests for cleaning days, maintenance, blocking
   # Estimated: 1.5 hours
   # Requires: _group_consecutive_dates() method
   ```

3. **Implement TestDynamicPricingRules (9 tests)**

   ```python
   # Location: test_pms_calendar_sync.py:252
   # Tests for pricing adjustments
   # Estimated: 2 hours
   # Requires: New pricing rule methods
   ```

4. **Implement TestCalendarHubIntegration (10 tests)**

   ```python
   # Location: test_pms_calendar_sync.py:310
   # Tests integration with calendar_hub tool
   # Estimated: 2 hours
   # Requires: Complete calendar_manager interaction
   ```

### Implementation Pattern to Follow

Each test set should follow this pattern:

```text
1. Read test file section
2. Understand test expectations
3. Replace pytest.skip() with actual test code
4. Run pytest - see RED phase (failures)
5. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
6. Run pytest - see GREEN phase (passing)
7. Refactor code for quality
8. Run pytest - ensure still passing
9. Commit changes
10. Move to next test section
```

### Daily Development Flow

```yaml
Morning:   Implement 1-2 test classes
Midday:    Run full test suite, review coverage
Afternoon: Implement features to pass tests
Evening:   Refactor, commit, daily standup
```

## 🔧 How to Continue Development

### For Team A

1. **Clone/navigate to worktree**

   ```bash
   cd /home/webemo-aaron/projects/agent-mahoo/.worktrees/pms-calendar
   git branch  # Verify: feature/pms-calendar-sync
   ```

2. **Review what's been implemented**

   ```bash
   cat instruments/custom/pms_hub/calendar_sync.py
   pytest tests/test_pms_calendar_sync.py::TestCalendarSyncServiceInitialization -v
   ```

3. **Continue with next test class**
   - Open `tests/test_pms_calendar_sync.py`
   - Find next test class with `pytest.skip()`
   - Implement test code (replace skip)
   - Run pytest to see failures
   - Add implementation methods as needed
   - Iterate until all tests in class pass

4. **Commit regularly**

   ```bash
   git add instruments/custom/pms_hub/calendar_sync.py tests/test_pms_calendar_sync.py
   git commit -m "feat(calendar): implement blocked dates sync with 5 tests"
   ```

### For Team B

1. **Start with Team A as reference**
   - Review `instruments/custom/pms_hub/calendar_sync.py` for patterns
   - Review `tests/test_pms_calendar_sync.py` for test structure
   - Review fixture usage in `tests/conftest.py`

2. **Begin your own TDD cycle**

   ```bash
   cd /home/webemo-aaron/projects/agent-mahoo/.worktrees/pms-messaging
   pytest tests/test_pms_communication_workflows.py::TestCommunicationWorkflowInitialization -v
   ```

3. **Create implementation file**

   ```bash
   # Create: instruments/custom/pms_hub/communication_workflows.py
   # Pattern to follow: Same structure as calendar_sync.py
   ```

4. **Start with initialization tests first**
   - Replace pytest.skip() in first test class
   - Create minimal class implementation
   - Get tests passing
   - Move to next test class

## 📞 Support & Debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Import errors for calendar_sync**

```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're in project root
cd /home/webemo-aaron/projects/agent-mahoo
python -c "from instruments.custom.pms_hub.calendar_sync import CalendarSyncService"
```

**Issue: Tests not finding fixtures**

```bash
# Solution: fixtures are defined in conftest.py
# Make sure tests are run from repo root
pytest tests/test_pms_calendar_sync.py -v
```

**Issue: EventBus initialization failing**

```bash
# Solution: Already fixed in implementation
# Uses EventStore with temporary database
# No action needed if using current calendar_sync.py
```

**Issue: Calendar Hub not available**

```bash
# Solution: Service gracefully degrades
# Tests should mock calendar_manager when needed
# Already implemented in current code
```
