## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

### ★ TDD Pattern Demonstrated

```text
RED Phase:     Test fails (specification)
GREEN Phase:   Minimal code to pass test
REFACTOR:      Clean up while keeping tests green
```

### ★ Service Architecture Pattern

```python
class ServiceName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = ProviderRegistry()
        try:
            self.external_service = Service()
        except ImportError:
            self.external_service = None

    async def main_method(self):
        try:
            # Do work
            await self.event_bus.emit(event_name, data)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            return None
```

### ★ Test Pattern

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_specific_case(self, sample_fixture):
    from module import Service
    from unittest.mock import patch

    service = Service()

    with patch.object(service, "external") as mock:
        mock.method.return_value = expected
        result = await service.method(sample_fixture)
        assert result == expected
        mock.method.assert_called_once()
```

4. Implement pricing rules next
5. Focus on 10-15 tests per day

### Team B

1. Study Team A's calendar_sync.py
2. Follow same architecture pattern
3. Create workflows.py with same structure
4. Start with initialization tests
5. Use same test patterns

### Both Teams

1. Commit frequently (after each test class)
2. Run tests regularly (after each change)
3. Keep tests green (never commit failing tests)
4. Daily 5-minute standup
5. Report blockers immediately
