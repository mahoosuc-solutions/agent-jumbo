# 🤖 AI Solutioning - Operator Quick Reference

## Overview

This guide covers the complete AI solutioning workflow for operators using Agent Mahoo. As an operator, you'll deliver end-to-end AI solutions from discovery through deployment and optimization.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start a New AI Solutioning Project

```json
{{workflow_engine(
  action="create_from_template",
  template_path="templates/ai_solutioning.json",
  name="Client ABC - AI Automation Project"
)}}
```

### 2. Begin Execution

```json
{{workflow_engine(
  action="start_workflow",
  workflow_name="Client ABC - AI Automation Project"
)}}
```

### 3. Track Progress

```json
{{workflow_engine(action="get_status", execution_id=1)}}
```

## 📋 The AI Solutioning Workflow

| Stage | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Discovery** | 3 days | Customer intake, Business X-Ray, requirements |
| **Solution Design** | 5 days | Task classification, workflow design, architecture |
| **Proposal** | 2 days | ROI calculation, proposal creation, roadmap |
| **POC** | 14 days | Build proof of concept, demo to customer |
| **Implementation** | 30 days | Full solution development, testing |
| **Deployment** | 5 days | CI/CD, containerization, go-live |
| **Training** | 3 days | Customer training sessions |
| **Optimization** | Ongoing | Monitor, optimize, enhance |

### Stage 2: Solution Design & Architecture

| Tool | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `ai_migration` | `classify_tasks` | Identify AI/Human tasks |
| `workflow_engine` | `create_workflow` | Design execution logic |
| `knowledge_base` | `search` | Consult architectural patterns |

**Architectural Excellence Guidelines:**

1. **Consult Patterns**: Always search `knowledge/custom/architectural_patterns/` before proposing a design. Familiarize yourself with EDA, Microservices, and Serverless patterns stored there.
2. **Trade-off Analysis**: Use the `tradeoff_analysis` skill to compare at least two architectural options (e.g., Centralized vs. Decentralized).
3. **WAF Alignment**: Ensure solutions align with the Azure Well-Architected Framework (Cost, Security, Reliability, Performance, Operational Excellence).

**Example Design Flow:**

```markdown
# 1. Search for patterns
{{knowledge_search(query="Event Driven Architecture for AI Agents")}}

# 2. Perform Trade-off Analysis
I've compared the Monolithic vs Event-Driven approach for Acme Corp.
- Results: EDA provides better horizontal scale but higher initial complexity.
- Recommendation: EDA via Azure Service Bus.
```

## � Swarm Coordination (Advanced)

For extremely complex projects (e.g., analyzing 50+ business processes simultaneously), use the **SwarmBatch** tool.

**Purpose**: Spawns multiple "specialist" agents in parallel. Each agent focuses on a sub-task and reports back to the master architect.

**Example Swarm Command:**

```json
{{swarm_batch(
  tasks=[
    "Analyze the manufacturing supply chain flow",
    "Evaluate the current inventory management database",
    "Identify security bottlenecks in the outbound shipping API"
  ],
  profile="architect"
)}}
```

## 📜 Architectural Memory (ADRs)

Agent Mahoo now features **Automated ADR Generation**.

- **Extraction**: Every time you conclude a technical decision, the `adr_generator` extension saves a record in `knowledge/custom/architectural_patterns/adrs/`.
- **Injection**: Future agents will automatically see these decisions in their system prompt via the `adr_context` extension. This ensures **Architectural Consistency** over time.
