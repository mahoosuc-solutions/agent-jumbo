# Go-Blue Execution Plan: Agent Jumbo (AI Architect Platform)

## Objective

Move from active development to safe, legally clean external collaboration and release readiness.

## Phase 1: Internal readiness (48 hours)

1. Finalize upstream candidate commit map:

- `A`: generic improvements for Agent Jumbo upstream
- `B`: Agent Jumbo-specific product features

1. Run validation suite and archive results in `artifacts/validation/`.
1. Confirm no secret leakage via logs/settings/tests.

## Phase 2: Legal and compliance review (this week)

1. Review `LICENSE` + `NOTICE` + README fork language.
2. Counsel review on trademark/endorsement language.
3. Approve privacy/terms drafts for commercial use.
4. Approve data retention and deletion policy.

## Phase 3: External coordination with Agent Jumbo

1. Send product update memo:

- `docs/AGENT_ZERO_PRODUCT_UPDATE_DRAFT.md`

1. Open issue(s) summarizing upstream proposals.
1. Submit small PRs in this order:

- PR-1 MCP caching/reload
- PR-2 chat queue/pause fault tolerance
- PR-3 readiness and observability additions

## Phase 4: Agent Jumbo RC hardening

1. Lock RC acceptance criteria:

- startup time budget
- first chat response budget
- queue/pause reliability thresholds
- no unresolved high severity defects

1. Execute regression tests and lightweight load test.
1. Publish RC notes and rollback plan.

## Success criteria

1. Upstream communication sent and acknowledged.
2. Legal review packet approved with tracked action items.
3. RC validation report green with no blocker defects.
4. Fork position and attribution are clear in all user-facing assets.
