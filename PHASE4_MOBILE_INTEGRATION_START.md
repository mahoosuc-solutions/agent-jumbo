# Phase 4: Full Phone Profile Data Sharing (Started)

We have successfully initiated the integration of full phone profile data sharing, starting with **Android**.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Persistent Storage

- Added `user_profiles` table to `data/workflow.db`.
- Fields: `full_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, `avatar_url`, `device_info` (JSON), `timezone`, `locale`.

### 2. Backend API

- Created `python/api/profile_sync.py` to handle profile updates from mobile devices.
- Implemented `update_profile` and `get_profile` actions.

### 3. Agent Personalization

- Updated `agent.py` to inject the synced phone profile into the system prompt.
- The agent now "knows" who it is talking to, their timezone, and their device context (e.g., battery levels, network status).

### 4. Android Implementation

- Created `profile-sync-store.js` which detects Android browsers.
- Implemented data gathering for:
  - **Identity**: Linked account info (placeholder for now, ready for Digital Credentials API).
  - **Environment**: Timezone and Locale.
  - **Device Status**: Battery level, charging state, network speed (downlink/RTT), and hardware cores/memory.
- Added "Sync Profile from Android" button to the Hardware Security settings.

### 5. Future: Apple (iOS) Integration

- The infrastructure is ready to accommodate Apple devices using the same API.
- iOS-specific data gathering (via Safari/WebKit) will be refined in the next iteration.
