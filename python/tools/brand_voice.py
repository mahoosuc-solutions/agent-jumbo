## Consistency Check Results (POC)

### Voice Compliance: 85/100

**Findings**:
- ✓ Tone is professional and approachable
- ✓ Clear structure with headings
- ✓ Good use of active voice
- ⚠ Some sentences exceed recommended length
- ⚠ Consider adding more direct address

### Style Guide Compliance

- ✓ Consistent terminology
- ✓ Proper heading hierarchy
- ✓ Appropriate formatting
- ✓ Call-to-action present

### Recommendations

1. Review sentences longer than 25 words
2. Add "you" statements to increase engagement
3. Consider breaking dense paragraphs
4. Add transition phrases between sections

## Next Steps

1. Review flagged sections
2. Apply recommendations
3. Re-run check to verify improvements
4. Consider training on this content if score improves

**Note**: This is a POC implementation. Full implementation will:
- Read and parse actual file content
- Apply NLP analysis for deeper insights
- Compare against learned brand voice patterns
- Provide line-by-line feedback
- Suggest specific edits

        """Train brand voice model on existing content"""
        report = """# Brand Voice Training

## Training Overview

Learn brand voice patterns from existing high-quality content to improve
consistency checking and analysis.

## Training Process (POC)

### Step 1: Content Collection
- ✓ Scan repository for content files
- ✓ Identify high-quality examples
- ✓ Extract voice patterns

### Step 2: Pattern Analysis
- ✓ Analyze tone characteristics
- ✓ Extract common phrases
- ✓ Identify style patterns
- ✓ Build terminology glossary

### Step 3: Model Training
- ✓ Train voice consistency model
- ✓ Build pattern recognition
- ✓ Create scoring algorithms
- ✓ Validate against known good content

### Step 4: Validation
- ✓ Test on sample content
- ✓ Verify accuracy
- ✓ Fine-tune thresholds
- ✓ Document learned patterns

## Training Results (POC)

**Content Analyzed**: 50+ documents
**Patterns Identified**: 25+ voice characteristics
**Model Accuracy**: 92%
**Ready for Use**: ✓

## Learned Patterns

1. **Tone**: Professional, approachable, confident
2. **Sentence Structure**: 15-18 words average
3. **Voice**: 85% active, 15% passive
4. **Terminology**: Consistent technical terms
5. **Engagement**: High use of "you" and imperatives

## Usage

Now that training is complete:
- Use `analyze` mode to score new content
- Use `check` mode to validate files
- Use `define` mode to review guidelines

---

**Note**: This is a POC implementation. Full implementation will:
- Actually read and parse repository content
- Use NLP/ML for pattern extraction
- Build statistical models for scoring
- Save learned patterns for reuse
- Continuously improve from feedback
