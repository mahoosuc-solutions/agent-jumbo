  INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING SETUP - POC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Environment: {environment.upper()}
Platform: {platform.upper()}

MONITORING CONFIGURATION:

Step 1: Metrics Collection Enabled ✓
{metrics_list}

Step 2: Dashboards Created ✓
{dashboards}

Step 3: Alert Rules Configured ✓
{alert_rules}

Step 4: Notification Channels Setup ✓
{notification_channels}

Step 5: Platform-Specific Setup ✓
{platform_details}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

MONITORING SUMMARY:

Environment: {environment}
Platform: {platform}
Status: ACTIVE ✓

Metrics Collected: 16 key metrics
Dashboards: 4 dashboards created
Alert Rules: 15 rules configured (4 critical, 5 high, 4 medium, 2 low)
Notification Channels: 3 channels (Slack, Email, PagerDuty)

Dashboard URLs (POC):
  → Infrastructure: http://{platform}.monitoring.local/dashboard/infrastructure
  → Application: http://{platform}.monitoring.local/dashboard/application
  → Database: http://{platform}.monitoring.local/dashboard/database
  → Alerts: http://{platform}.monitoring.local/dashboard/alerts

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

NEXT STEPS:

1. Access dashboards at URLs above
2. Test alert notifications:
   - Simulate high CPU to trigger alert
   - Verify Slack/Email/PagerDuty notifications
3. Review alert thresholds and adjust as needed
4. Create runbooks for common alerts
5. Schedule regular monitoring review meetings
6. Document escalation procedures

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

NOTE: This is a POC implementation demonstrating the monitoring setup.
Full implementation will integrate with actual monitoring platforms:

{platform.upper()} Integration:
- Configure API keys and authentication
- Install monitoring agents on infrastructure
- Set up real-time data collection
- Create custom dashboards based on your needs
- Configure actual notification webhooks
- Test alert rules with realistic thresholds
