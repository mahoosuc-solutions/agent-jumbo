## Design & Build (DEVB System)

The DEVB System implements NVIDIA's approach to pre-production validation: design, emulate, validate, and generate specifications before building - catching design flaws in simulation rather than expensive production implementation.

### `/design:solution` - Create Design Specification

Create comprehensive specifications for any solution type (workflow chains, features, infrastructure, complete solutions)

**Usage**: `/design:solution`

**Interactive Prompts**:

- Solution name (required)
- Solution type: workflow-chain | feature | infrastructure | complete-solution
- Description (required)
- Functional requirements (comma-separated list)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, tech stack)
- Dependencies (existing systems)
- Architecture description (optional)

**Outputs**:

- Design specification with all components
- Component definitions (services, APIs, databases)
- Data model schema changes
- API contract definitions
- Workflow chain compositions
- Design stored in PostgreSQL with full-text search

**Example**:

```text
/design:solution

Solution Name: Revenue Growth Automation
Type: complete-solution
Description: AI-powered revenue analytics with Stripe integration...
[interactive prompts continue]

✅ Design created: rev-growth-automation-001
Next: /design:emulate [design-id]
```

**Use Case**: Starting point for any new solution design

---

### `/design:emulate` - Emulate Solution Without Building

Test solutions without side effects using three emulation methods to find design flaws before implementation

**Usage**: `/design:emulate [design-id|design-name]`

**Emulation Methods**:

1. **Dry-Run** - Execute workflow chains with mocked dependencies (no database writes)
2. **Static Analysis** - Analyze design for security, performance, database issues
3. **Simulation** - Test mock implementations with test data and edge cases

**Outputs** (For each method):

- Issues found (critical, high, medium, low)
- Estimated fix times
- Actionable recommendations
- Overall quality score (0-100)
- Details on execution time, resource usage, data flows

**Example Results**:

```text
DRY-RUN: Executed 8 workflow steps in 2.4 seconds
- Found 0 critical errors, 0 high severity issues

STATIC ANALYSIS: Analyzed 12 components
- Critical: Missing Stripe API error handling (1 issue)
- High: N+1 query in revenue dashboard (1 issue)
- Medium: Missing database indexes (2 issues)

SIMULATION: Tested 12 scenarios with mock data
- Success rate: 91.7% (11/12 passed)
- Race condition found in cache updates

Overall Quality Score: 75/100
Recommendation: Fix critical issues before validation
```

**Next**: `/design:validate [design-id]`

---

### `/design:validate` - Multi-Perspective AI Validation

Validate design from 4 perspectives (Security, Performance, Cost, UX) before generating specifications

**Usage**: `/design:validate [design-id|design-name]`

**4 Validation Perspectives**:

1. **Security & Compliance** (0-100 score)
   - Authentication (OAuth, JWT, Sessions)
   - Authorization and access control
   - Data protection (encryption, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
   - Vulnerability assessment (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
   - Compliance readiness (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2)

2. **Performance & Scalability** (0-100 score)
   - Database optimization (N+1 queries, indexes)
   - Caching strategy evaluation
   - Load capacity (max concurrent users)
   - API latency targets (P95, P99)
   - Horizontal scaling readiness

3. **Cost & ROI** (0-100 score)
   - Infrastructure cost estimation (compute, storage, bandwidth)
   - Maintenance cost projection
   - ROI timeline (payback period)
   - Cost per user metrics
   - Cost optimization opportunities

4. **User Experience** (0-100 score)
   - API design quality (REST compliance)
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA)
   - Documentation quality and coverage
   - Error handling clarity
   - Mobile responsiveness

**Outputs**:

- Individual score for each perspective (0-100)
- Overall design score (average of 4)
- Readiness status: READY (≥80) | NEEDS_FIXES (60-79) | BLOCKED (<60)
- Critical issues with fix time estimates
- Recommendations for improvement

**Example Results**:

```yaml
SECURITY: 82/100 ✅
- JWT with refresh tokens ✅
- Encryption at rest/transit ✅
- HIPAA Ready: Yes ✅
- Issues: Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (HIGH - 2-3 hours)

PERFORMANCE: 75/100 ⚠️
