## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Document Analysis and Structure Detection

Parse and analyze the input document to identify:

- Document type (journal article, conference paper, technical report, whitepaper, thesis)
- Structure and sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)
- Key metadata (authors, affiliations, publication venue, date, DOI)
- Citation style and reference format
- Figures, tables, and supplementary materials
- Length and complexity level

Detect content organization patterns:

- IMRAD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion)
- Hypothesis-driven vs. exploratory research
- Empirical studies vs. theoretical/review papers
- Single study vs. systematic review/meta-analysis
- Quantitative vs. qualitative methods

Extract document metadata:

- Title and subtitle
- Author names and credentials
- Institution and funding sources
- Keywords and subject classifications
- Publication details (journal, volume, issue, pages)
- Digital identifiers (DOI, arXiv ID, PubMed ID)

### Step 2: Content Segmentation and Prioritization

Divide document into logical segments:

- **Critical sections**: Abstract, conclusions, key findings
- **Methodology sections**: Study design, participants, procedures, analysis
- **Results sections**: Primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, statistics

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Academic Paper Summary (Technical Audience)

```bash
/summarize --length medium --audience technical --format narrative
```

**Input**: "Deep Learning for Medical Image Segmentation: A Survey" (30 pages)

**Output** (500 words):

```yaml
Title: Deep Learning for Medical Image Segmentation: A Survey
Authors: Zhang et al. (2024) | Journal: Medical Image Analysis | DOI: 10.1016/j.media.2024.xxxxx

OVERVIEW
This comprehensive survey examines deep learning approaches for medical image segmentation,
reviewing 287 papers published 2018-2024. The authors systematically analyze architectures,
datasets, evaluation metrics, and clinical applications across radiology, pathology, and
microscopy domains.

METHODOLOGY
The authors conducted a systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines, searching
PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv for peer-reviewed papers. They categorized approaches into
five architecture families: U-Net variants (43%), Transformer-based models (28%), GANs (15%),
attention mechanisms (10%), and hybrid approaches (4%). Performance was evaluated using
Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and clinical validation metrics.

KEY FINDINGS
1. U-Net variants remain dominant (43% of papers) but Transformer-based models show 22%
   average performance improvement (Dice: 0.89 vs. 0.73, p < 0.001) on complex multi-organ
   segmentation tasks.

2. Data augmentation techniques improved generalization by 31% on average, with elastic
   deformations and mixup strategies most effective (8.3 percentage point Dice improvement).

3. Transfer learning from ImageNet reduced required training samples by 65% (from 1,000+
   to 350 images) while maintaining comparable performance (Dice difference: 0.02).

4. Clinical validation studies (n=47) showed 89% of deep learning models matched or
   exceeded expert radiologist performance, with 12% faster inference time.

5. Domain adaptation techniques addressed distribution shift, improving cross-scanner
   performance by 27% (Dice: 0.81 vs. 0.64 without adaptation).

IMPLICATIONS
The maturation of deep learning segmentation enables practical clinical deployment.
Transformer architectures show particular promise for whole-slide pathology images (10,000+
x 10,000+ pixels). However, the field must address limited datasets for rare diseases,
model interpretability concerns, and regulatory approval pathways.

LIMITATIONS
The survey excludes non-English papers (potential 15% coverage gap), focuses on published
work (publication bias toward positive results), and notes that only 23% of papers provided
publicly available code, limiting reproducibility. Most studies used retrospective data;
prospective clinical trials remain limited (n=12).

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Promising areas include few-shot learning for rare diseases, federated learning for privacy-
preserving multi-center studies, uncertainty quantification for clinical decision support,
and integration with clinical workflow systems. The authors call for standardized benchmarks
and open-source implementations.

BREAKTHROUGH IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE TREATMENT

What the Study Found
Scientists have successfully used a powerful gene-editing tool called CRISPR to potentially
cure sickle cell disease, a painful inherited blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.
In a groundbreaking clinical trial, 28 of 29 patients (97%) who received the treatment
showed dramatic improvements, with most becoming completely free of painful crises that
previously required hospitalization.

How It Works (Simplified)
Think of CRISPR as molecular scissors that can cut and edit DNA like you would edit a
document. Sickle cell disease is caused by a tiny typo in the genetic code that makes red
blood cells crescent-shaped instead of round. These misshapen cells can get stuck in blood
vessels, causing excruciating pain and organ damage.

The treatment works in three steps:
1. Doctors extract bone marrow cells from the patient
2. They use CRISPR to fix the genetic typo in these cells in the laboratory
3. They infuse the corrected cells back into the patient

Within months, the corrected cells start producing healthy, round red blood cells that flow
smoothly through vessels without causing problems.

- **Don't** use absolute language when original was qualified ("proves" vs. "suggests")
- **Don't** inject personal opinions or interpretations not in original
- **Don't** assume all readers know field-specific jargon
- **Don't** create summaries longer than requested
- **Don't** forget to cite the original source properly

### Pro Tips for Advanced Users
