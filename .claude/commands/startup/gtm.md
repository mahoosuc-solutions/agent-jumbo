---

## Step 1: Product & Market Analysis

Before generating the GTM plan, Claude will ask you strategic questions:

### Product Questions

```text
1. What problem does your product solve?
   - Example: "Email overload - professionals waste 10+ hours/week"

2. What's your unique solution?
   - Example: "AI email triage that auto-categorizes and prioritizes"

3. What's your unfair advantage?
   - Example: "Proprietary algorithm trained on 15K SaaS professionals' inboxes"

4. What's your pricing model?
   - Options: Free trial → Paid, Freemium, One-time purchase, Usage-based
   - Example: "$29/month after 14-day free trial"

5. What's your current product stage?
   - MVP (core features only)
   - Beta (feature-complete, needs testing)
   - Launch (ready for public release)
   - Growth (launched, scaling now)
```

### Market Questions

```text
1. Who is your ideal customer?
   - Demographics: Age, location, job title, income
   - Psychographics: Values, pain points, goals
   - Example: "Founders/CEOs of 10-100 person SaaS companies, USA, overwhelmed by email"

2. What's your total addressable market (TAM)?
   - Example: "500K SaaS companies in USA, 30% have email pain point = 150K TAM"

3. Who are your top 3 competitors?
   - Example: "Superhuman, Spark, SaneBox"

4. What's your differentiation?
   - Example: "We're 1/3 the price of Superhuman, 3x better AI than SaneBox"

5. What channels does your audience use?
   - Example: "LinkedIn (professional), Twitter (tech community), Product Hunt (early adopters)"
```

### Budget Questions

```text
1. What's your total marketing budget?
   - Example: "$10,000 for 90-day launch period"

2. How should budget be split?
   - Paid ads: 40-50% ($4K-5K)
   - Content/influencer: 20-30% ($2K-3K)
   - Tools/software: 10-15% ($1K-1.5K)
   - Contingency: 10-20% ($1K-2K)

3. What's your customer acquisition cost (CAC) target?
   - Example: "Under $50 per trial signup, under $150 per paying customer"

4. What's your expected customer lifetime value (LTV)?
   - Example: "$29/month × 12 months avg retention = $348 LTV"

5. What's your LTV:CAC ratio target?
   - Rule of thumb: 3:1 or better
   - Example: "$348 LTV ÷ $150 CAC = 2.3:1 (acceptable, aim for 3:1)"
```

```

### Week -2 to -1: Press & Influencer Outreach

**Pitch Email Template**:
```

Subject: [Exclusive] AI email tool saves professionals 8.5 hrs/week (beta results)

Hi [First Name],

I saw your recent piece on [article title] - loved your take on [specific insight].

I'm reaching out because I built something your readers might find interesting: an AI email tool that saves professionals 8.5 hours/week (backed by data from 100 beta users).

- Average time saved: 8.5 hours/week
- 78% said it increased their deal close rate (for sales professionals)

**Why Now**: We're launching on Product Hunt on [Date] and offering lifetime pricing at $19/month (vs. $29 regular).

**What I'm Offering**:

- Exclusive early access for you to test (before public launch)
- 1:1 interview with me (founder story, AI insights)

Would you be interested in covering this? Happy to provide whatever you need.

Best,

- Day 3: Polite follow-up if no response
- Day 7: Share additional traction data (new beta results, waitlist growth)
- Day 10: Offer different angle (founder story, AI technical deep-dive)
- Day 14: Final follow-up, then move on

**Press Kit** (Hosted on website):
- Founder high-res photos (3-5 headshots, action shots)
- Product screenshots (high-res, annotated)

- Company logos (PNG, SVG in various sizes)
- Beta user testimonials (quotes, photos, permissions)

```

#### Influencer Collaboration

```markdown
**Influencer Tiers**:
- **Micro (10K-50K followers)**: $500-2K per post, highest engagement
- **Mid-tier (50K-200K followers)**: $2K-10K per post, good reach
- **Macro (200K+ followers)**: $10K-50K per post, broad awareness

**Budget Allocation** (Assuming $10K marketing budget):
- 5-10 micro-influencers: $500-1K each = $5K-10K
- 1-2 mid-tier influencers: $2K-5K each = $2K-10K
- Skip macro (too expensive for early-stage)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], founder of [Product]. I built this because I was wasting 10+ hours/week on email and couldn't find a solution that actually worked.

**The Problem**:
The average professional spends 28% of their workday on email. Existing tools are either too expensive ($30/month for Superhuman) or too basic (simple filters).

**Our Solution**:
AI email triage that learns your priorities and auto-organizes, prioritizes, and drafts responses.

**Beta Results** (100 users, 2 weeks):

- 92% said they "can't go back" to manual email
- Average time saved: 8.5 hours/week
- 78% said it increased their productivity

**Product Hunt Exclusive**:
First 100 signups get lifetime pricing at $19/month (vs. $29 regular).

Happy to answer any questions! 🙏

```text

**Comment Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to EVERY comment within 15 minutes (first 2 hours critical)
- Upvote every comment (shows engagement)
- Provide value in responses (not just "thank you")
- Ask follow-up questions (build relationships)
- Tag relevant team members (e.g., "@jane from our team can answer that")
- Pin important questions/answers (highlight key features)

**Upvote Strategy**:
- Ask close network to upvote in first hour (momentum is critical)
- Don't spam - Product Hunt detects and penalizes fake upvotes
- Quality over quantity - engaged users > silent upvotes

## Post-Launch Optimization (Days 1-30)

### Week 1 Priorities

**Goal**: Respond to feedback, fix critical issues, maintain momentum

```markdown
**Day 1-3: Firefighting**
□ Monitor product stability (uptime, errors, performance)
□ Respond to every support request within 2 hours
□ Fix critical bugs immediately (payment, signup, core features)
□ Collect feedback from early users (survey, interviews)
□ Post launch recap: "We launched yesterday! Here's what happened"
  - Share metrics: Signups, Product Hunt rank, revenue
  - Lessons learned: What worked, what didn't
  - Thank everyone who supported

**Day 4-7: Iteration**
□ Analyze user behavior (Mixpanel/Amplitude dashboards)
  - Where do users drop off? (onboarding, pricing page, feature adoption)
  - What features are used most? (double down on these)
  - What features are ignored? (consider removing or improving)
□ A/B test key pages (landing page, pricing page)
□ Implement quick wins (based on feedback)
□ Send follow-up email to trial users:
  - "How's it going? Any questions?"
  - Feature highlight: "Did you know you can...?"
  - Ask for feedback: "What would make this a 10/10 for you?"

**Week 1 Metrics to Track**:
- Signups: 100-500 target (launch week)
- Activation rate: 70%+ (users complete onboarding)
- Trial-to-paid conversion: 10-20% target (after 14 days)
- Churn rate: <5% in first month
- NPS score: 40+ (good), 50+ (great), 70+ (amazing)
- Support ticket volume: Expect 3-5x normal (launch spike)
```

### Week 2-4: Optimization & Growth

```markdown
**Feedback Loop System**:

**1. Collect Feedback**:
□ In-app surveys (after key actions: onboarding, feature use)
□ Email surveys (NPS, feature requests, pain points)
□ User interviews (1:1 calls with power users and churned users)
□ Support ticket analysis (common issues, feature requests)
□ Social media monitoring (Twitter, Reddit mentions)

**2. Categorize Feedback**:
□ **Critical bugs** (fix immediately)
□ **Quick wins** (high impact, low effort - do next)
□ **Feature requests** (prioritize by user demand + strategic fit)
□ **Nice-to-haves** (backlog)

**3. Act on Feedback**:
□ Communicate fixes: "You asked, we listened!"
  - Email users who requested feature
  - Post on social media
  - Update changelog
□ Close the loop: Thank users who provided feedback
□ Build in public: Share progress on roadmap

**Pricing Optimization**:

**Experiments to Run**:
1. **Trial length**: 7-day vs. 14-day vs. 30-day
   - Hypothesis: Longer trial = higher conversion (users form habit)
   - Measure: Trial-to-paid conversion rate

2. **Pricing tiers**: Single plan vs. 3 tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
   - Hypothesis: 3 tiers increase ACV (anchor effect)
   - Measure: Average revenue per user (ARPU)

3. **Discounts**: First month $1 vs. 20% off vs. no discount
   - Hypothesis: Low barrier to entry increases conversions
   - Measure: CAC, LTV, payback period

4. **Annual billing**: Monthly vs. Annual (2 months free)
   - Hypothesis: Annual prepay improves cash flow and retention
   - Measure: % of users choosing annual, churn rate

**Growth Loops to Implement**:

**1. Referral Program**:
- Incentive: "Give $10, get $10" (or 1 month free for both)
- Mechanism: Unique referral link in product
- Trigger: After user completes onboarding (day 7)
- Goal: 15-20% of users refer at least 1 person

**2. Content Flywheel**:
- User generates value in product (e.g., organized inbox)
- Offer to share achievement on social media
- Template: "I saved 8.5 hours this week with [Product]!"
- Goal: 5-10% of users share organically

**3. Network Effects**:
- Invite team members (e.g., "Your team can save 8.5 hrs/week each")
- Team dashboard (see everyone's productivity gains)
- Viral trigger: "Your teammate [Name] saved 12 hours last week!"

**Week 2-4 Metrics**:
- Weekly signups: 50-200 target (post-launch steady state)
- Activation rate: 75%+ (improving with onboarding tweaks)
- Trial-to-paid conversion: 15-25% (improving with optimization)
- MRR growth: 20-30% week-over-week
- Virality coefficient: 0.3-0.5 (each user brings 0.3-0.5 new users)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

```markdown
**Pre-Launch Mistakes**:
❌ Building for too long (6+ months) without customer feedback
✅ Launch MVP in 1-3 months, iterate based on real users

❌ Waiting for "perfect" product before launch
✅ Launch at 80% done, fix 20% based on feedback

❌ Not building waitlist (launching to crickets)
✅ Build 500-1,000 person waitlist before launch

❌ Launching without beta users
✅ Get 50-100 beta users, gather testimonials

**Launch Day Mistakes**:
❌ Launching on Friday or weekend (low traffic)
✅ Launch Tuesday-Thursday for maximum attention

❌ Not responding to comments/feedback
✅ Respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes

❌ Being defensive about criticism
✅ Thank critics, show you're listening, explain roadmap

❌ Not tracking metrics
✅ Real-time dashboard, monitor signups/conversions

**Post-Launch Mistakes**:
❌ Disappearing after launch day
✅ Maintain momentum with daily posts

❌ Ignoring churned users
✅ Interview churned users, fix their pain points

❌ Building features nobody asked for
✅ Build what users request most

❌ Not testing pricing
✅ A/B test pricing, trial length, discounts

**Growth Mistakes**:
❌ Trying every channel at once
✅ Focus on 1-2 channels, master them, then expand

❌ Scaling paid ads too fast (before unit economics work)
✅ Prove LTV:CAC >3:1, then scale

❌ Neglecting existing customers (chasing new)
✅ Retention > acquisition (keep customers happy)

❌ Not building in public
✅ Share metrics, lessons, transparency builds trust
```

### Step 2: Calculate Key Metrics

**Output to user**: `⏳ Step 2/11: Calculating key metrics and targets...`

Based on inputs from Step 1 and command parameters:

```javascript
const metrics = {
  budget: params.budget, // from --budget parameter
  timeline: params.timeline, // from --timeline parameter (days)

  // Calculate daily budget
  dailyBudget: params.budget / params.timeline,

  // Estimate target CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
  // Rule: CAC should be < 1/3 of LTV for healthy unit economics
  targetCAC: expectedLTV / 3,

  // Estimate number of conversions needed
  targetConversions: params.budget / targetCAC,

  // Calculate LTV:CAC ratio (should be > 3:1)
  ltvCacRatio: expectedLTV / targetCAC,

  // Pre-launch timeline
  preLaunchWeeks: Math.floor(params.timeline / 30) * 4, // 4 weeks before launch

  // Launch date
  launchDate: calculateDate(params.timeline)
