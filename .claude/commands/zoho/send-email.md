Send email via Zoho Mail with the following workflow:

## Step 1: Parse Input & Determine Mode

**Input Options**:

- `/send-email john@example.com welcome` - Recipient + template name
- `/send-email john@example.com` - Recipient only (interactive compose)
- `/send-email` - Fully interactive mode

Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine:

- Recipient email(s)
- Template to use (if specified)
- Compose mode (template vs custom)

## Step 2: Recipient Management

Use **AskUserQuestion** to collect/confirm recipients:

**Single Recipient Mode**:

- Email address
- Display name (optional)
- Contact type (Lead, Contact, Vendor, Other)

**Multiple Recipients** (if requested):

- Primary recipients (To:)
- CC recipients
- BCC recipients

**Validation**:

- Verify email format
- Check for common typos
- Warn if sending to multiple recipients
- Confirm if sending outside organization

## Step 3: Email Content Creation

### Option A: Use Template (if template name provided)

1. **Check for template file**:
   - Look in `/templates/email/[template-name].md`
   - If found, read template content
   - If not found, list available templates

2. **Template Structure**:

   ```markdown
   ---
   subject: [Email subject with {{merge fields}}]
   category: [welcome|followup|newsletter|campaign]
   ---

   # Email Body

   Hi {{firstName}},

   [Email content with {{merge fields}}]

   Best regards,
   {{senderName}}
   ```

3. **Merge Fields**: Use **AskUserQuestion** to collect values for merge fields:
   - {{firstName}}, {{lastName}}, {{company}}, etc.
   - Pre-fill from Zoho CRM if recipient is a known contact/lead

### Option B: Custom Email (if no template)

Use **AskUserQuestion** to collect:

- **Subject line**: Clear, compelling subject
- **Email body**: Compose email content
- **Format**: Plain text or HTML
- **Attachments**: Any files to attach (list paths)

Provide AI assistance:

- Suggest subject line based on context
- Help draft professional email body
- Recommend best practices (clear CTA, personalization, etc.)

## Step 4: Email Enhancement

Enhance the email with:

1. **Personalization**:
   - Use recipient's first name
   - Reference their company if known
   - Customize based on lead source/status

2. **Professional Formatting**:
   - Proper greeting
   - Clear structure (paragraphs, spacing)
   - Professional signature
   - Unsubscribe link (if campaign email)

3. **Quality Check**:
   - Grammar and spelling check
   - Tone analysis (professional, friendly, urgent, etc.)
   - Length optimization (not too long/short)
   - Mobile-friendly formatting

4. **Compliance**:
   - CAN-SPAM compliance for campaigns
   - GDPR compliance for EU recipients
   - Unsubscribe mechanism included

## Step 5: Email Preview

   Body: {
     "fromAddress": "sender@domain.com",

     "ccAddress": "",
     "bccAddress": "",
     "subject": "Subject",
     "content": "Email body",
     "mailFormat": "html",
     "attachments": []
   }
   ```

2. Display success confirmation:

   ```text
   ✓ Email Sent Successfully!
