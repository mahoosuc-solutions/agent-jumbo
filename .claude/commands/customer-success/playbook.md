### 2. Expansion - Upsell Tier Upgrade

**Scenario**: Customer on lower tier, showing signals ready for upgrade (usage at limits, growth patterns)
**Success Rate**: 65% conversion (historical)
**Timeline**: 30-45 days to close

**Step-by-Step Playbook**:

**Phase 1: Opportunity Qualification (Days 1-7)**

**Step 1 - Validate Expansion Signals (Day 1-2)**

- [ ] Confirm usage approaching limits (>75% of licenses, storage, API calls)
- [ ] Check growth trajectory (user count, usage volume increasing)
- [ ] Verify health score (must be >60 to pursue expansion)
- [ ] Assess champion strength (need internal advocate)
- [ ] Review budget timing (in budget cycle? upcoming renewal?)

**Expected Output**: Expansion opportunity qualified (go/no-go decision)

**Step 2 - Calculate Value Proposition (Day 3-4)**

- [ ] Estimate customer's ROI from upgrade:
  - **Cost of current limitations**: What's it costing them to be constrained?
    - Example: "Manually managing 9/10 users = 5 hours/month"
  - **Value of upgrade**: What will they gain?
    - Example: "Enterprise admin features save 15 hours/month"
  - **Net benefit**: Quantify ROI
    - Example: "Save 20 hours/month = $2,000 value vs. $200/month upgrade cost = 10x ROI"
- [ ] Prepare ROI calculator (personalized to their situation)

**Expected Output**: Compelling value proposition with quantified ROI

**Step 3 - Build Business Case (Day 5-7)**

- [ ] Create expansion proposal document:
  - **Executive summary**: Why upgrade, why now
  - **Current state challenges**: Specific limitations they're hitting
  - **Proposed solution**: Upgrade to [Tier], unlock [features]
  - **ROI analysis**: Cost vs. benefit breakdown
  - **Case study**: Similar customer success story
  - **Implementation**: Simple, low-disruption (typically immediate)
  - **Pricing**: Transparent (current vs. new, prorated options)
- [ ] Get internal approval (pricing, discount authority)

**Expected Output**: Professional proposal ready to present

**Phase 2: Engagement & Demo (Days 7-21)**

**Step 4 - Initial Outreach (Day 7-10)**

- [ ] CSM sends personalized email (not generic sales pitch):
  - Subject: "[Customer], you're close to your [license/storage/API] limit - let's plan ahead"
  - Body: Specific observations (usage data), value framing, soft CTA
- [ ] Follow up with phone call if no response within 3 days
- [ ] Goal: Book 20-minute discovery call

**Expected Output**: Discovery call scheduled

**Step 5 - Discovery Call (Day 10-14)**

- [ ] Attendees: Champion + CSM (and AE if sales-led account)
- [ ] Agenda:
  1. Share observations (usage data, growth patterns)
  2. Ask about future plans (hiring, expansion, new use cases)
  3. Probe constraints (are current limits creating friction?)
  4. Introduce upgrade option (benefits, pricing)
  5. Offer demo of premium features
- [ ] Book demo within 7 days if interested

**Expected Output**: Interest level gauged, demo scheduled (if qualified)

**Step 6 - Personalized Demo (Day 14-21)**

- [ ] Prepare demo focused on THEIR needs (not feature dump)
- [ ] Show:
  - Features that solve their specific constraints
  - ROI calculator with their data
  - Case study from similar customer
- [ ] Address objections:
  - **Price concern**: Show ROI (value >> cost)
  - **Timing concern**: Offer prorated pricing or delay until renewal
  - **Complexity concern**: Emphasize simplicity (instant upgrade, no disruption)
- [ ] Provide proposal document after demo
- [ ] Set clear next step: "Decision by [date]?"

**Expected Output**: Proposal delivered, decision timeline established

**Phase 3: Negotiation & Close (Days 21-45)**

**Step 7 - Follow-Up & Objection Handling (Day 21-30)**

- [ ] Follow up 3 days after proposal (email + call)
- [ ] If no response, multi-touch sequence:
  - **Touch 1**: Email (Day 24) - "Checking in on proposal"
  - **Touch 2**: Case study email (Day 27) - Social proof
  - **Touch 3**: Phone call (Day 30) - Direct conversation
- [ ] Surface and address objections:
  - **Budget**: Offer payment plan, delay until renewal, show cost of inaction
  - **Buy-in**: Offer to present to decision-maker, provide exec-level summary
  - **Timing**: Explore if "not now" means "not ever" or just "later"

**Expected Output**: Objections surfaced and addressed, moving toward decision

**Step 8 - Close & Contract (Day 30-45)**

- [ ] Once verbal "yes", move quickly to contract:
  - Send order form same day
  - Offer to walk through procurement process
  - Provide legal/security docs if needed (enterprise)
- [ ] Set expectation: "Upgrade takes effect within 24 hours of signing"
- [ ] Celebrate internally (update CRM, notify team)

**Expected Output**: Contract signed, upgrade executed

**Phase 4: Post-Upgrade Success (Day 45+)**

**Step 9 - Upgrade Onboarding (Day 45-60)**

- [ ] Schedule "Welcome to [Tier]" call:
  - Tour new features
  - Set goals for utilizing premium capabilities
  - Offer advanced training
- [ ] Monitor usage of new features (are they actually using what they paid for?)
- [ ] Check satisfaction (quick survey: "How's the upgrade going?")

**Expected Output**: Customer actively using new tier, satisfied with upgrade

**Step 10 - Expansion Documentation (Day 60)**

- [ ] Update CRM (health score likely improved, expansion ARR added)
- [ ] Document success story (use for future expansion plays)
- [ ] Identify next expansion opportunity (cross-sell, multi-year, etc.)

**Expected Output**: Expansion success documented, next growth opportunity identified

### 5. Property Management - Tenant At-Risk (Lease Renewal)

**Scenario**: Tenant showing signs of non-renewal (maintenance complaints, late payments, low engagement)
**Success Rate**: 60% retention (property management specific)
**Timeline**: 30-60 days before lease end

**Step-by-Step Playbook**:

**Phase 1: Early Warning Detection (90 days before lease end)**

**Step 1 - Identify At-Risk Signals (Day 1)**

- [ ] Review tenant health indicators:
  - **Payment patterns**: Late payments, declined auto-pay, inquiries about breaking lease
  - **Maintenance satisfaction**: Unresolved tickets, slow response complaints
  - **Engagement**: No portal logins, ignoring community events, curt responses
  - **External signals**: LinkedIn shows job change/relocation, lease inquiry sites visited
- [ ] Calculate churn risk score (0-100)
- [ ] Flag for immediate intervention if risk >60%

**Expected Output**: At-risk tenant identified, risk level quantified

**Step 2 - Root Cause Analysis (Day 1-3)**

- [ ] Review tenant history:
  - Maintenance tickets: Volume, resolution time, satisfaction scores
  - Rent payment: On-time vs. late patterns, financial stress signals
  - Neighbor relations: Noise complaints, parking conflicts
  - Unit condition: Age, recent issues, amenities vs. market
- [ ] Identify likely reasons for dissatisfaction:
  - **Maintenance responsiveness**: Avg ticket resolution time >72 hours?
  - **Pricing pressure**: Market rent dropped but they're locked at higher rate?
  - **Life changes**: Job relocation, family size change, financial hardship?
  - **Competition**: New property opened nearby with better amenities?

**Expected Output**: Root cause(s) identified, intervention strategy clear

**Step 3 - Competitive Intelligence (Day 3-5)**

- [ ] Research competitive landscape:
  - What are comparable units renting for? (Zillow, Apartments.com)
  - New properties opening nearby?
  - Competitors offering move-in specials?
- [ ] Calculate retention offer parameters:
  - Max discount: How much can we reduce rent and still be profitable?
  - Value-adds: Parking upgrade, unit improvements, lease flexibility
  - Breakeven: What's cost of vacancy + turnover vs. retention concession?

**Expected Output**: Competitive positioning, retention offer parameters

**Phase 2: Proactive Intervention (60-90 days before lease end)**

**Step 4 - Outreach & Discovery (Day 5-10)**

- [ ] Property manager schedules face-to-face meeting (not email, not phone)
- [ ] Approach: "We value you as a tenant. Your lease is coming up - let's talk about your plans."
- [ ] Discovery questions:
  - "Are you planning to renew?" (direct, not assuming)
  - "How's everything been? Any concerns we should address?"
  - "What would make you want to stay long-term?"
  - "If you're considering leaving, can you share why?" (no judgment, just learning)
- [ ] Listen actively, take notes, don't defend or sell yet

**Expected Output**: Tenant intentions surfaced, concerns documented

**Step 5 - Rapid Issue Resolution (Day 10-17)**

- [ ] Address immediate concerns FAST:
  - **Maintenance backlog**: Resolve all open tickets within 48 hours
  - **Unit improvements**: Offer upgrades (new appliances, fresh paint, carpet cleaning)
  - **Neighbor conflicts**: Mediate and resolve (parking reassignment, quiet hours enforcement)
- [ ] Over-deliver on responsiveness (show commitment to their satisfaction)

**Expected Output**: Top complaints resolved, goodwill rebuilt

**Step 6 - Renewal Offer Presentation (Day 17-30)**

- [ ] Craft competitive renewal offer:
  - **Option 1**: Market-rate renewal (if market < current)
  - **Option 2**: Rent lock (same rate) for 18-month commitment
  - **Option 3**: Slight discount (5-10%) for 24-month commitment
  - **Sweeteners**: Free parking month, unit upgrade, flexible move-in for additional tenant
- [ ] Present in person (shows importance, builds relationship)
- [ ] Frame as partnership: "We want to keep you. Here's what we can do."
- [ ] Provide comparison: "Here's what moving would cost you" (moving expenses, deposits, time)

**Expected Output**: Renewal offer presented, tenant considering

**Phase 3: Negotiation & Close (30-45 days before lease end)**

**Step 7 - Follow-Up & Negotiation (Day 30-40)**

- [ ] Follow up 5 days after offer (give time to consider)
- [ ] If tenant pushes back:
  - **Price objection**: "Competitor is $100/month cheaper"
    - Counter: Match price OR show value difference (amenities, location, service)
  - **Flexibility objection**: "Need shorter lease term"
    - Counter: Offer 6-month renewal at slight premium (vs. standard 12-month)
  - **Dissatisfaction**: "Still unhappy with maintenance"
    - Counter: Commit to guaranteed response SLA (all tickets resolved <48 hours) + direct PM phone number
- [ ] Find win-win solution (retention is goal, not maximum rent)

**Expected Output**: Agreement reached or clear "no" (at least you tried)

**Step 8 - Renewal Execution (Day 40-45)**

- [ ] Once verbal "yes":
  - Send lease renewal documents within 24 hours
  - Offer e-signature (make it easy)
  - Set lease start date (seamless, no move-out/move-in)
- [ ] Celebrate: Personal thank-you note, small gift (gift card, resident appreciation event invite)

**Expected Output**: Lease renewed, tenant retained

**Phase 4: Post-Renewal Relationship Building**

**Step 9 - Ensure Satisfaction (First 30 days of new lease)**

- [ ] Follow up after renewal: "How's everything going? Any concerns?"
- [ ] Deliver on commitments (if you promised maintenance SLA, track it rigorously)
- [ ] Build relationship: Invite to resident events, respond quickly to requests
- [ ] Goal: Turn retained tenant into long-term, happy tenant (reduce future churn risk)

**Expected Output**: Tenant satisfaction high, relationship strengthened

**Step 10 - Document & Learn (Day 60)**

- [ ] Update CRM: Tenant health score, renewal notes, retention cost
- [ ] Calculate ROI:
  - **Retention value**: Avoided vacancy cost ($2,000) + turnover cost ($1,500) + 12 months rent ($21,600) = $25,100 retained value
  - **Retention cost**: Concession ($100/month discount × 12 = $1,200) + unit improvements ($500) = $1,700
  - **Net benefit**: $25,100 - $1,700 = $23,400 value saved
- [ ] Share learnings: What worked? What didn't? How prevent churn earlier?

**Expected Output**: Retention success documented, playbook refined for next time

  - Option 1: $1,750/month (matching market) for 12 months
  - Option 2: $1,800/month (same rate) for 18 months
  - Sweetener: One month free parking ($75 value)

**Week 3: Negotiation & Close**
- [ ] Day 17: Follow up on offer - Address concerns
- [ ] Day 20: Close renewal or secure decision timeline
- [ ] Day 21: Send lease renewal documents (e-signature)

**Expected Outcome**: 60% probability of renewal (based on historical data for this risk profile)
