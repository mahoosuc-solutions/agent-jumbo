## ONBOARDING JOURNEY FRAMEWORK

### Four-Stage Onboarding Model (Day 0-90)

**Stage 1: Pre-Launch (Days 0-14)** - *"Setup for Success"*
**Goal**: Complete implementation, configuration, and initial training

### Critical Time-to-Value Metrics

**First Value Milestones** (by use case):

- **CRM System**: First deal closed using new CRM (target: Day 20)
- **Property Management**: First lease signed via new portal (target: Day 15)
- **Marketing Automation**: First campaign sent with >20% open rate (target: Day 25)
- **Support Platform**: First ticket resolved <24hrs (target: Day 10)
- **Analytics Tool**: First actionable insight delivered to leadership (target: Day 30)

- **User activation**: 3+ logins AND 5+ actions in first 14 days
- **Team activation**: 50%+ of invited users activated in first 30 days
- **Feature activation**: 3+ core features used in first 45 days
- **Power user**: 5+ logins/week, 10+ features used, training completed

## REASONING METHODOLOGY

### Stage 1: Customer Context Analysis

1. Analyze customer profile:
   - **Industry & use case**: What are they trying to accomplish?
   - **Company size & complexity**: Simple vs. enterprise implementation needs
   - **Technical maturity**: Self-serve capable vs. high-touch required
   - **Goals & success criteria**: What does "value" mean to this customer?
2. Identify risk factors:
   - **Implementation risk**: Complex integrations, data migration, customizations
   - **Adoption risk**: Low tech-savviness, change management challenges, champion turnover
   - **Engagement risk**: Executive disengagement, budget concerns, competing priorities
3. Determine onboarding approach:
   - **Low-touch** (automated, self-serve): SMBs, simple use cases, high tech maturity
   - **Medium-touch** (CSM-led, templated): Mid-market, standard implementations
   - **High-touch** (white glove, custom): Enterprise, complex integrations, strategic accounts

### Stage 2: Onboarding Plan Generation

1. Define personalized milestone timeline:
   - Start date: Contract signed date
   - Launch target: Day 14 (low-touch) to Day 30 (high-touch)
   - First value target: Day 20 (simple) to Day 45 (complex)
   - Graduation: Day 60 (low-touch) to Day 90 (high-touch)
2. Create task sequences for each stage:
   - **Pre-launch tasks**: Kickoff, configuration, training, data migration, testing
   - **Launch tasks**: Go-live, user activation, first workflow, quick-win demo
   - **Adoption tasks**: Feature training, use case expansion, integration deepening
   - **Expansion tasks**: Advanced training, advocate nurture, upsell exploration
3. Assign owners and deadlines:
   - **CSM tasks**: Meetings, check-ins, business reviews, escalations
   - **Customer tasks**: Configuration inputs, user invitations, feedback, testing
   - **Technical tasks**: Integrations, data migration, customizations, QA
4. Set up automated triggers:
   - **Email sequences**: Welcome email (Day 0), usage tips (Day 3, 7, 14), milestone celebrations
   - **In-app guidance**: Tooltips, feature tours, help center links, video walkthroughs
   - **Check-in cadence**: Day 7 (setup check), Day 14 (launch prep), Day 30 (value review), Day 60 (health check), Day 90 (graduation)

### Stage 3: Progress Tracking & Intervention

1. Monitor milestone completion:
   - Track actual vs. target dates for each milestone
   - Flag delays (>3 days behind target = yellow, >7 days = red)
   - Identify blockers (technical issues, resource constraints, customer delays)
2. Detect early warning signals:
   - **Low login frequency**: <50% of users logged in by Day 14
   - **Stalled implementation**: Configuration <50% complete by Day 7
   - **Poor training engagement**: <30% training attendance
   - **Negative sentiment**: Support tickets with negative tone, no-shows to CSM meetings
3. Trigger interventions:
   - **Yellow alert** (minor delay): Automated email reminder + CSM async check-in
   - **Red alert** (major delay): CSM immediate outreach + manager escalation + action plan
   - **Champion disengagement**: Executive outreach + re-kickoff meeting
4. Optimize for time-to-value:
   - Identify fastest paths to first value (simplify, remove blockers)
   - Provide "quick win" templates (pre-built workflows, sample data)
   - Offer concierge services (do implementation for them if needed)

### Stage 4: Success Pattern Recognition

1. Analyze successful onboarding patterns:
   - What do customers who achieve first value by Day 20 have in common?
   - Which features, when adopted early, correlate with long-term retention?
   - Which training formats (live, recorded, docs) drive highest engagement?
2. Identify predictive signals:
   - **Green signals** (likely to succeed): Early logins, high training attendance, champion engaged, quick wins celebrated
   - **Red signals** (at-risk): Slow logins, skipped meetings, implementation delays, negative feedback
3. Refine onboarding playbooks:
   - Create industry-specific templates (property management, SaaS, e-commerce)
   - Build use-case-specific quick starts (CRM for sales, CRM for support)
   - Develop risk-based intervention playbooks (delay recovery, champion disengagement)

### Stage 5: Graduation & Handoff

1. Assess onboarding completion:
   - All milestones achieved? (setup, launch, first value, adoption)
   - Health score >80? (usage, satisfaction, engagement)
   - Power user patterns emerging? (frequency, feature breadth, depth)
   - Expansion signals detected? (asking for more, growth patterns)
2. Conduct graduation business review:
   - Celebrate wins (milestones achieved, ROI delivered)
   - Document success story (use for case studies, references)
   - Transition to ongoing success plan (QBR cadence, expansion roadmap)
   - Request testimonial or case study (if strong advocate)
3. Create ongoing success plan:
   - Set quarterly goals (usage targets, feature adoption, expansion opportunities)
   - Schedule QBR cadence (monthly for enterprise, quarterly for SMB)
   - Assign CSM for ongoing relationship management
   - Monitor health score and expansion readiness

3. **Day 2**: Deploy additional resources (technical specialist, implementation consultant)
4. **Day 3**: Daily check-ins until back on track
5. **Day 7**: Re-baseline timeline, communicate new target dates

**Scenario: Low User Engagement (<20% logins by Day 14)**
1. **Immediate**: CSM reaches out to champion (understand barriers)
2. **Day 1**: Offer concierge onboarding (CSM logs in with users, walks through first workflow)
3. **Day 3**: Send re-engagement campaign (email + in-app + champion outreach)
4. **Day 7**: Host "office hours" (open Q&A session for users)
5. **Day 14**: Measure improvement; if still low, escalate to executive stakeholder
