## HEALTH SCORE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### Multi-Dimensional Scoring Model (0-100 scale)

**1. Product Engagement & Usage (30 points)** - *Enhanced with Usage Tracking*

- Login frequency (8 pts): Daily=8, Weekly=5, Monthly=3, Rare=0
- Feature adoption (8 pts): Power user=8, Regular=5, Limited=3, Minimal=0
- Active users vs. licenses (7 pts): >80%=7, 60-80%=5, 40-60%=3, <40%=0
- **Usage quota utilization (7 pts)**: 60-80%=7, 80-95%=5, <40%=3, >100%=2, 0%=0

```sql
-- Pull usage engagement metrics
SELECT
  uq.customer_id,
  AVG(uq.usage_percentage) as avg_utilization,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ue.metric_type) as metrics_used,
  SUM(ue.quantity) as total_usage_events,
  MAX(ue.recorded_at) as last_activity,
  -- Engagement scoring
  CASE
    WHEN AVG(uq.usage_percentage) BETWEEN 60 AND 80 THEN 7
    WHEN AVG(uq.usage_percentage) BETWEEN 80 AND 95 THEN 5
    WHEN AVG(uq.usage_percentage) < 40 THEN 3
    WHEN AVG(uq.usage_percentage) > 100 THEN 2  -- Overuse may indicate frustration
    ELSE 0
  END as usage_score
FROM usage_quotas uq
LEFT JOIN usage_events ue ON ue.customer_id = uq.customer_id
WHERE uq.customer_id = '${customer_id}'
  AND uq.period_start <= NOW()
  AND uq.period_end > NOW()
GROUP BY uq.customer_id;
```

**2. Financial & Billing Health (25 points)** - *Enhanced with Billing System*

- Payment timeliness (8 pts): Auto-pay=8, On-time=6, Late=2, Delinquent=0
- Contract value trend (7 pts): Growing=7, Stable=5, Declining=2, Churned=0
- **Dunning status (5 pts)**: None=5, Stage 1-2=3, Stage 3+=0
- **Invoice/Refund history (5 pts)**: Clean=5, Minor issues=3, Disputes=0

```sql
-- Pull billing health metrics
SELECT
  s.organization_id as customer_id,
  s.tier,
  s.mrr_cents,
  s.status as subscription_status,
  -- Payment history from billing events
  COUNT(CASE WHEN be.event_type = 'payment_succeeded' THEN 1 END) as successful_payments,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN be.event_type = 'payment_failed' THEN 1 END) as failed_payments,
  MAX(CASE WHEN be.dunning_stage > 0 THEN be.dunning_stage END) as max_dunning_stage,
  SUM(CASE WHEN be.event_type = 'refund' THEN be.amount_cents ELSE 0 END) as total_refunds_cents,
  -- Contract value trend
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT new_tier FROM subscription_events
     WHERE subscription_id = s.id
     ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1),
    s.tier
  ) as latest_tier_change,
  -- Billing score calculation
  CASE
    WHEN MAX(be.dunning_stage) >= 3 THEN 0
    WHEN MAX(be.dunning_stage) BETWEEN 1 AND 2 THEN 3
    WHEN MAX(be.dunning_stage) IS NULL OR MAX(be.dunning_stage) = 0 THEN 5
  END as dunning_score,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN be.event_type = 'refund' THEN 1 END) > 2 THEN 0
    WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN be.event_type = 'refund' THEN 1 END) BETWEEN 1 AND 2 THEN 3
    ELSE 5
  END as invoice_history_score
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN billing_events be ON be.customer_id = s.organization_id
  AND be.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
WHERE s.organization_id = '${customer_id}'
GROUP BY s.id, s.organization_id, s.tier, s.mrr_cents, s.status;
```

**3. Customer Satisfaction (25 points)**

- NPS score (10 pts): Promoter(9-10)=10, Passive(7-8)=5, Detractor(0-6)=0
- Support ticket sentiment (10 pts): Positive=10, Neutral=5, Negative=0
- Survey response rate (5 pts): Always responds=5, Sometimes=3, Never=0

- Champion presence (5 pts): Strong champion=5, Weak champion=2, None=0
- QBR attendance (5 pts): Always attends=5, Sometimes=3, Skips=0

### Subscription & License Health Indicators

For **SaaS customers**, also consider:

```sql
-- Subscription health indicators
SELECT
  s.id as subscription_id,
  s.status,
  s.seats_purchased,
  s.seats_used,
  ROUND(s.seats_used::numeric / NULLIF(s.seats_purchased, 0) * 100, 1) as seat_utilization,
  s.current_period_end - NOW() as days_until_renewal,
  CASE
    WHEN s.status = 'past_due' THEN 'CRITICAL'
    WHEN s.status = 'canceled' THEN 'CHURNED'
    WHEN s.current_period_end - NOW() < INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'RENEWAL_SOON'
    WHEN s.seats_used::numeric / NULLIF(s.seats_purchased, 0) < 0.5 THEN 'UNDERUTILIZED'
    ELSE 'HEALTHY'
  END as health_indicator
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE s.organization_id = '${customer_id}';
```

For **Local Install customers**, also consider:

```sql
-- License health indicators
SELECT
  l.id as license_id,
  l.status,
  l.max_seats,
  COUNT(la.id) as active_activations,
  l.expires_at - NOW() as days_until_expiry,
  MAX(la.last_validated_at) as last_validation,
  CASE
    WHEN l.status = 'revoked' THEN 'CRITICAL'
    WHEN l.status = 'expired' THEN 'CHURNED'
    WHEN l.expires_at - NOW() < INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'RENEWAL_SOON'
    WHEN MAX(la.last_validated_at) < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'INACTIVE'
    ELSE 'HEALTHY'
  END as health_indicator
FROM licenses l
LEFT JOIN license_activations la ON la.license_id = l.id AND la.status = 'active'
WHERE l.organization_id = '${customer_id}'
GROUP BY l.id;
```

### Enhanced Churn Risk Classification

| Score Range | Risk Level | Billing/Usage Signals | Action |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| **0-39** | Critical | Dunning stage 3+, 0% usage, past due | Executive escalation, urgent intervention |
| **40-59** | High | Dunning stage 1-2, <20% usage, refunds | CSM intervention, value demonstration |
| **60-79** | At Risk | Declining usage, late payments, quota exceeded | Proactive outreach, training |
| **80-100** | Healthy | On-time payments, 60-80% usage, expanding | Expansion opportunities, advocacy |

### Churn Risk Calculation Formula

```text
Churn Risk % = 100 - Health Score + Billing_Risk_Modifier + Usage_Risk_Modifier

Where:
- Billing_Risk_Modifier:
  - Dunning Stage 1-2: +5%
  - Dunning Stage 3+: +15%
  - Multiple refunds: +5%
  - Past due status: +20%

- Usage_Risk_Modifier:
  - 0% utilization: +15%
  - <20% utilization: +10%
  - Declining trend (>20% drop): +10%
  - Quota exceeded (frustrated): +5%
```

## REASONING METHODOLOGY

### Stage 1: Data Collection & Validation

1. Fetch customer data from Zoho CRM (contacts, accounts, deals)
2. Retrieve engagement metrics (login logs, feature usage analytics)
3. Pull financial data (payment history, contract details, ARR/MRR)
4. Collect satisfaction scores (NPS, CSAT, support ticket sentiment)
5. Validate data completeness (flag missing critical metrics)

### Stage 2: Health Score Calculation

1. Calculate sub-scores for each dimension (engagement, financial, satisfaction, relationship)
2. Apply weighted formula: (Engagement×0.30) + (Financial×0.25) + (Satisfaction×0.25) + (Relationship×0.20)
3. Normalize to 0-100 scale
4. Classify risk level based on score thresholds
5. Identify primary risk factors (which dimensions are weakest)

### Stage 3: Churn Risk Prediction

1. Analyze trend lines (is health improving or declining?)
2. Identify leading indicators of churn:
   - Decreased login frequency (>40% drop in 30 days)
   - Support ticket spike with negative sentiment
   - Executive disengagement (no contact in 60+ days)
   - Payment delays or downgrades
   - Champion departure or role change
3. Calculate churn probability percentage
4. Predict likely churn timeframe (immediate, 30 days, 60 days, 90+ days)

### Stage 4: Retention Strategy Generation

1. Match risk profile to proven retention playbooks
2. Prioritize intervention tactics by impact:
   - **Critical Risk**: Executive-to-executive outreach, urgent business review, custom success plan
   - **High Risk**: CSM intervention, feature training, value demonstration
   - **At Risk**: Proactive check-in, education resources, community engagement
3. Generate personalized action plan with specific next steps
4. Assign ownership (CSM, AE, Exec) and deadlines

### Stage 5: Reporting & Actionability

1. Generate customer health dashboard (visual + tabular)
2. Prioritize customers by risk + revenue impact (ICE score: Impact × Confidence × Ease)
3. Create retention task list with ownership and due dates
4. Export to Zoho CRM (update health score field, create tasks)
5. Schedule automated follow-up analysis (recurring health checks)
