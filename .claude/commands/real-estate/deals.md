# /real-estate:deals - Investment Analysis & Deal Evaluation

Analyze potential property deals with cash flow projections, ROI calculations, and decision scoring.

## Quick Start

**Analyze a new deal:**

```bash
/real-estate:deals analyze
```

**Evaluate multiple properties:**

```bash
/real-estate:deals compare
```

**Track deal pipeline:**

```bash
/real-estate:deals pipeline
```

**Calculate returns:**

```bash
/real-estate:deals calc
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **deal-centric real estate analysis** where:

1. Every potential property is evaluated systematically
2. Financial projections are calculated (cash flow, ROI, IRR)
3. Deals are scored against investment criteria
4. Decisions are data-driven (not emotion-driven)

**Key Principle**: You must systematically evaluate every deal. Most deals won't meet your criteria. A few exceptional deals will.

## Mode 4: CALC - Financial Calculators

Quick calculations for deal evaluation.

### Key Calculations

**Cash-on-Cash Return**:

```text
= Annual cash flow / Initial cash investment
= $9,180 / $62,000
= 14.8%

Target: 8%+
```

**Cap Rate**:

```text
= Net Operating Income / Property Value
= $7,500 / $310,000
= 2.4%

Note: Lower in appreciating markets, higher in cash-heavy markets
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**:

```text
Combines cash flow + appreciation + equity paydown
Typical target: 10%+ annually
```

**Cash Flow Formula**:

```text
Monthly = Gross Rent - (Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance + Maintenance + Mgmt)
Annual = Monthly × 12
```

---

## Deal Selection Criteria

**Financial Thresholds**:

- Cash-on-cash return: ≥8% (target 10%+)
- Cap rate: ≥2.5% (market dependent)
- Positive cash flow: YES (never cash flow negative)
- Down payment available: YES (don't stretch)

**Market Criteria**:

- Growing economy/population
- Strong rental demand
- Appreciating values (1%+ annually)
- Good schools (if residential)

**Property Criteria**:

- Good condition (avoid major repairs)
- Good bones (newer is not necessary)
- Tenant-ready or easily renovated
- Clear title, no liens

**Seller Criteria**:

- Motivated (willing to negotiate)
- Flexible (open to owner financing if needed)
- Honest about property condition

---

## Data Storage

Deal data is saved in:

**JSON File** (CLI):

```text
.claude/data/deals.json
├── Deal analyses (all properties evaluated)
├── Scoring results (decision data)
├── Financial projections (cash flow, ROI)
├── Pipeline status (tracking opportunities)
└── Closed deals (acquisition history)
```

---

## Integration with Life Goals

Each deal must support financial independence:

```text
LIFE GOAL: Financial Independence
├── Real estate generates passive income: YES
│   ├── Target: $60K/year passive income
│   ├── Each deal must generate $15K+ annually
│   ├── ROI: 8%+ cash-on-cash return minimum
│   └── Path: 4 properties @ $15K each = $60K
└── Decision framework: Only buy deals that hit targets
```

---

## Success Criteria
