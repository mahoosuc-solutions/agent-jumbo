# /real-estate:tenants - Tenant Lifecycle Management

Track tenants from application through screening, leasing, rent collection, and renewal with communication history.

## Quick Start

**Screen a new applicant:**

```bash
/real-estate:tenants apply
```

**List all tenants:**

```bash
/real-estate:tenants list
```

**Manage tenant record:**

```bash
/real-estate:tenants manage
```

**Log communication:**

```bash
/real-estate:tenants communicate
```

**Track rent collection:**

```bash
/real-estate:tenants rent
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **tenant-centric property management** where:

1. Applicants are screened systematically (credit, background, income)
2. Leases are tracked with clear terms and renewal dates
3. Rent collection is monitored (on-time payments, delinquencies)
4. Communication is logged for legal protection

**Key Principle**: Good tenants = reliable cash flow. Screening and selection is the most important step.
