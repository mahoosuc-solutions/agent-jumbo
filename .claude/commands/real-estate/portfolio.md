# /real-estate:portfolio - Property Portfolio Management

Track all properties with valuations, equity positions, cash flow, and measure ROI against financial independence goals.

## Quick Start

**Add a new property:**

```bash
/real-estate:portfolio add
```

**List all properties:**

```bash
/real-estate:portfolio list
```

**Analyze portfolio performance:**

```bash
/real-estate:portfolio analyze
```

**View portfolio dashboard:**

```bash
/real-estate:portfolio dashboard
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **portfolio-centric real estate management** where:

1. Every property is tracked for value and cash flow
2. ROI is measured per property and aggregated
3. Properties are evaluated against financial independence goals
4. Portfolio diversification and risk are managed

**Key Principle**: Real estate is a wealth-building tool that generates cash flow (passive income) and appreciation (capital gains). The goal is to build a diversified portfolio generating enough passive income to support financial independence.
