# /real-estate:maintenance - Maintenance & Repair Management

Create work orders, manage vendor relationships, track repair expenses, and maintain property condition records.

## Quick Start

**Create maintenance request:**

```bash
/real-estate:maintenance request
```

**Track work order:**

```bash
/real-estate:maintenance track
```

**Manage vendors:**

```bash
/real-estate:maintenance vendor
```

**Monitor expenses:**

```bash
/real-estate:maintenance expense
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **maintenance-centric property operations** where:

1. Maintenance requests are tracked systematically (prevent reactive emergencies)
2. Vendors are rated and managed (quality + cost control)
3. Expenses are categorized (repairs vs. improvements)
4. Property condition is monitored (catch issues early)

**Key Principle**: Preventive maintenance costs less than emergency repairs. Regular upkeep extends property life and protects your investment.
