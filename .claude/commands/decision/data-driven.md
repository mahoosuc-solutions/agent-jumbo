## Data-Driven Decision Process

### Step 1: Define Decision & Data Needs

```text
DECISION: [What needs to be decided]

OPTIONS:
A. [Option 1]
B. [Option 2]
C. [Option 3]

DATA NEEDED TO DECIDE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL DATA (Must have to decide):
1. [Data point 1] - Without this, we're guessing
   Source: [Where to get it]
   Effort: [Easy/Medium/Hard to obtain]

2. [Data point 2] - Core to the decision
   Source: [Where to get it]
   Effort: [Easy/Medium/Hard to obtain]

3. [Data point 3] - Make/break assumption
   Source: [Where to get it]
   Effort: [Easy/Medium/Hard to obtain]

IMPORTANT DATA (Strongly influences decision):
4. [Data point 4] - Materially impacts outcome
5. [Data point 5] - Helps quantify risk/reward

NICE-TO-HAVE DATA (Adds context but not critical):
6. [Data point 6] - Interesting but not decisive
7. [Data point 7] - Additional perspective

DATA WE WON'T GATHER (Not worth the effort):
- [Data point 8] - Too expensive/time-consuming
- [Data point 9] - Unlikely to change decision
```

### Step 2: Gather Available Data

For each data source, attempt to gather data:

```

### Step 3: Analyze Data for Insights

```text
DATA ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS
═════════════════════════

INSIGHT 1: Feature Gap is Critical
───────────────────────────────────
DATA POINTS:
- 80% of interviewed customers want [Feature X]
- 100% of churn interviews mentioned missing [Feature X]
- 18% of support tickets are requests for [Feature X]
- Competitor A has [Feature X] (mentioned in 30% of their reviews)

CONFIDENCE: ████████░░ 8/10 (High)

INSIGHT: [Feature X] is likely a major driver of churn and
a blocker for expansion. Building it should be top priority.

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- Churn reduction: 5.2% → 3.5% (-33%)
- Customer satisfaction: NPS 42 → 55 (+13 points)
- Expansion revenue: Customers willing to pay +20% for this

ESTIMATED VALUE: $15K/month MRR increase within 6 months


INSIGHT 2: Pricing is Not the Problem
──────────────────────────────────────
DATA POINTS:
- We're priced at median ($500/mo) for our category
- LTV:CAC ratio is 4.9x (healthy, above 3x minimum)
- Top objection is "too expensive" but customers stay (5.2% churn)
- 6/10 customers said "pricing is fair"

CONFIDENCE: ███████░░░ 7/10 (Good)

INSIGHT: "Too expensive" objection is likely a POSITIONING
problem, not a pricing problem. We're not communicating value
well enough in sales process.

EXPECTED IMPACT (if we fix positioning):
- Win rate: 22% → 28% (+27%)
- Sales cycle: 58 days → 50 days (-14%)
- Deal size: $500 → $575 (+15% by selling higher tier)

ESTIMATED VALUE: $8K/month MRR increase within 3 months


INSIGHT 3: Support Issues Hurting Retention
────────────────────────────────────────────
DATA POINTS:
- Response time: 18 hours (goal: 4 hours)
- Resolution time: 3.2 days (goal: 1 day)
- 35% of tickets are "How do I do X?" (onboarding issue)
- Churn is 5.2% (slightly above median 4-5%)

CONFIDENCE: ████████░░ 8/10 (High)

INSIGHT: Slow support is likely driving churn. Improving
response time and onboarding could materially reduce churn.

EXPECTED IMPACT (if we improve support):
- Churn reduction: 5.2% → 4.0% (-23%)
- NPS increase: 42 → 50 (+8 points)

ESTIMATED VALUE: $6K/month MRR saved from reduced churn


INSIGHT 4: We're Well-Positioned vs Competitors
────────────────────────────────────────────────
DATA POINTS:
- Competitor A: 4.2/5 stars, "complex/hard to use"
- Competitor B: 4.6/5 stars, "missing features"
- We: 9/10 customers love our simplicity
- We have more features than B, simpler UX than A

CONFIDENCE: ███████░░░ 7/10 (Good)

INSIGHT: We're in the "Goldilocks zone" - more features than
simple competitors, simpler than complex competitors. This is
a strong positioning story we're not telling.

EXPECTED IMPACT (if we market this positioning):
- Brand awareness: +30% (easier to explain differentiation)
- Win rate: 22% → 26% (+18%)
- Deal size: Can charge premium for "simple power"

ESTIMATED VALUE: $5K/month MRR increase within 6 months
```

### Step 4: Identify Data Gaps & Criticality

```text
DATA GAPS ANALYSIS
══════════════════

What data do we WISH we had?

HIGH-PRIORITY GAPS (Should gather before deciding):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Detailed Competitor Pricing & Packaging
   - What we know: Base prices ($99-$999/month range)
   - What we DON'T know: Feature breakdown by tier, usage limits
   - Why it matters: Could reveal pricing/packaging opportunity
   - How to get it: Sign up for free trials, talk to 5 customers who switched
   - Effort: 1 week, $0 cost
   - RECOMMENDATION: ✓ GATHER THIS (high impact, low effort)

2. Customer Willingness to Pay (Van Westendorp)
   - What we know: Current price is $500/month
   - What we DON'T know: Optimal price point, price sensitivity curve
   - Why it matters: Could be leaving 20%+ revenue on table
   - How to get it: Survey 50 customers with price sensitivity questions
   - Effort: 1 week, $0 cost (use Typeform)
   - RECOMMENDATION: ✓ GATHER THIS (high impact, low effort)

3. Feature X Development Cost Estimate
   - What we know: Customers want it badly
   - What we DON'T know: How long to build, opportunity cost
   - Why it matters: Need to prioritize against other features
   - How to get it: Engineering estimate + product spec
   - Effort: 3 days, $0 cost
   - RECOMMENDATION: ✓ GATHER THIS (critical for decision)


MEDIUM-PRIORITY GAPS (Nice to have but not critical):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Market Share Data
   - What we know: We're small, Competitor A is leader
   - What we DON'T know: Exact market share percentages
   - Why it matters: Helps understand growth ceiling
   - How to get it: Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
   - Effort: 2 weeks, $5,000+ cost for reports
   - RECOMMENDATION: ✗ SKIP (interesting but not actionable)

5. Customer Acquisition Channel Attribution
   - What we know: Leads come from content, referrals, ads
   - What we DON'T know: True ROI by channel (multi-touch)
   - Why it matters: Could optimize marketing spend
   - How to get it: Implement proper attribution (Segment, etc.)
   - Effort: 4 weeks, $10,000+ cost
   - RECOMMENDATION: → DEFER (important but not urgent for this decision)


LOW-PRIORITY GAPS (Don't need for this decision):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. Lifetime Customer Cohort Analysis
7. Detailed Competitor Tech Stack
8. Industry-wide Churn Benchmarks by Segment

[These would be nice but won't materially change the decision]
```

### Step 5: Synthesize into Data-Driven Recommendation

```text
DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATION
═══════════════════════════

DECISION: [Restate the decision being made]

RECOMMENDATION: [Option X]

CONFIDENCE: ███████░░░ 7/10 (Good - Based on solid data with some gaps)

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THIS RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. [Data point 1] (Confidence: 8/10)
   → [How this supports the recommendation]

2. [Data point 2] (Confidence: 9/10)
   → [How this supports the recommendation]

3. [Data point 3] (Confidence: 7/10)
   → [How this supports the recommendation]

EVIDENCE AGAINST THIS RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. [Data point that challenges recommendation] (Confidence: 6/10)
   → [Why we're proceeding despite this]

2. [Risk factor identified in data] (Confidence: 7/10)
   → [Mitigation strategy]

ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE (Due to Data Gaps):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ ASSUMPTION 1: [What we're assuming]
   Risk if wrong: [Impact]
   Validation plan: [How we'll test this assumption]

⚠️ ASSUMPTION 2: [What we're assuming]
   Risk if wrong: [Impact]
   Validation plan: [How we'll test this assumption]

QUANTIFIED EXPECTED IMPACT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If we execute this recommendation:

3-MONTH PROJECTIONS:
- Revenue: $50K → $58K MRR (+16%)
- Churn: 5.2% → 4.8% (-8%)
- Win rate: 22% → 25% (+14%)
- [Other key metric]

12-MONTH PROJECTIONS:
- Revenue: $50K → $95K MRR (+90%)
- Customers: 100 → 210 (+110%)
- CAC payback: 10mo → 8mo (-20%)
- [Other key metric]

CONFIDENCE IN PROJECTIONS: ██████░░░░ 6/10 (Medium)
These are educated estimates based on available data and
industry benchmarks. Actual results could vary ±30%.

DATA-DRIVEN ACTION PLAN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMMEDIATE (Week 1-2):
1. Gather high-priority data gaps identified above
2. Validate top 3 assumptions with customer interviews
3. Build detailed implementation plan with engineering

SHORT-TERM (Month 1-3):
4. [Specific action based on data insight 1]
5. [Specific action based on data insight 2]
6. [Specific action based on data insight 3]

MEDIUM-TERM (Month 4-6):
7. [Strategic action]
8. [Strategic action]

SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Track these metrics weekly to validate assumptions:

30-DAY CHECKPOINT:
- Metric 1: Target [X], Actual [___]
- Metric 2: Target [Y], Actual [___]
- Decision: Continue / Adjust / Abort

90-DAY CHECKPOINT:
- Metric 3: Target [Z], Actual [___]
- Metric 4: Target [W], Actual [___]
- Decision: Scale up / Stay course / Pivot

ABORT CRITERIA (When to abandon this decision):
⚠️ If [metric X] < [threshold] by [date]
⚠️ If [assumption Y] proves false
⚠️ If [risk Z] materializes
```

## Real-World Example: Should we hire a VP of Sales?

```text
DECISION: Hire VP of Sales now vs. founder does sales 6 more months

DATA GATHERING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INTERNAL DATA:
✓ Current MRR: $50K
✓ Pipeline: $120K (2.4x monthly target)
✓ Avg sales cycle: 58 days
✓ Win rate: 22%
✓ Founder sales time: 25 hours/week
✓ Founder product time: 10 hours/week (down from 30)

MARKET DATA:
✓ Median VP Sales salary: $150K base + $50K variable
✓ Time to hire: 2-3 months
✓ Time to ramp: 3-4 months
✓ Typical quota: 3-5x salary = $600K-$1M/year

COMPETITOR DATA:
✓ Competitor A hired VP Sales at $2M ARR (we're at $600K ARR)
✓ Competitor B still founder-led at $3M ARR
✓ Competitor C hired at $1M ARR, grew to $10M in 18mo

CUSTOMER DATA:
✓ Interviewed 10 customers: 8/10 said "sales process was fine"
✓ Main objection: Price (not sales process quality)
✓ Customers value talking to founder (trust signal)

EXPERT DATA:
✓ Advisor 1 (ex-CRO): "Don't hire VP until $1M ARR minimum"
✓ Advisor 2 (VC): "Hire when founder time is constraint"
✓ Industry benchmark: Hire VP Sales at $1-2M ARR

DATA ANALYSIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━

INSIGHT 1: We're below typical threshold ($600K vs $1M+)
INSIGHT 2: Sales process isn't broken (22% win rate is normal)
INSIGHT 3: Founder time is constraint (product suffering)
INSIGHT 4: ROI unclear (6-month ramp before productivity)

RECOMMENDATION: DELAY hiring VP Sales for 6 months

CONFIDENCE: ████████░░ 8/10 (High)

REASONING:
1. Data shows we're below typical hiring threshold ($600K vs $1M)
2. Customers value founder involvement (trust signal)
3. Main issue is pricing/positioning, not sales capacity
4. 6-month delay allows us to:
   - Hit $1M ARR (better for VP candidate quality)
   - Fix pricing/positioning first (improve win rate)
   - Build more repeatable sales process (easier to hand off)
   - Save $100K in cash (extends runway)

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- Delay hiring by 6 months
- Use time to improve win rate from 22% to 28%
- Build sales playbook (easier VP onboarding later)
- Hit $1M ARR milestone (hire higher-quality VP)
- Save $100K cash (6 months of salary)

VALIDATION PLAN:
Month 3: If founder time < 20hrs/week on sales, we're on track
Month 6: If MRR > $80K, hire VP; if < $70K, reconsider strategy
```

## Data Confidence Scoring

For each data point, assign confidence score:

```text
CONFIDENCE SCALE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

10/10: ██████████ Verified, our own data, large sample
 9/10: █████████░ Verified, third-party data, large sample
 8/10: ████████░░ Verified, reputable source, good sample
 7/10: ███████░░░ Likely accurate, decent source, ok sample
 6/10: ██████░░░░ Plausible, mixed sources, small sample
 5/10: █████░░░░░ Uncertain, limited sources, anecdotal
 4/10: ████░░░░░░ Questionable, weak sources
 3/10: ███░░░░░░░ Speculative, very limited data
 2/10: ██░░░░░░░░ Guess, no real data
 1/10: █░░░░░░░░░ Complete guess

OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN RECOMMENDATION:
= Weighted average of confidence scores for data points used

Example:
- Data point A: 9/10 confidence, 40% weight → 3.6
- Data point B: 7/10 confidence, 30% weight → 2.1
- Data point C: 5/10 confidence, 20% weight → 1.0
- Data point D: 8/10 confidence, 10% weight → 0.8
= Overall: 7.5/10 confidence
```
