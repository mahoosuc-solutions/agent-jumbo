## INVOICE WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Customer & Subscription Data

```sql
SELECT
  s.id as subscription_id,
  s.stripe_subscription_id,
  s.stripe_customer_id,
  s.tier,
  s.billing_cycle,
  s.mrr_cents,
  s.seats_purchased,
  o.name as organization_name,
  o.billing_email,
  o.billing_address,
  o.tax_id,
  o.tax_exempt,
  c.name as contact_name,
  c.email as contact_email
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN organizations o ON s.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN contacts c ON o.primary_contact_id = c.id
WHERE s.id = '${subscription_id}'
   OR s.organization_id = '${customer_id}'
   OR s.stripe_customer_id = '${customer_id}';
```

### Phase 2: Calculate Invoice Items

#### Recurring Invoice Items

```sql
-- Subscription line items
SELECT
  'Subscription - ' || s.tier || ' Plan' as description,
  s.mrr_cents as unit_amount,
  1 as quantity,
  s.billing_cycle as period
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE s.id = '${subscription_id}';

-- Additional seats
SELECT
  'Additional Seats (' || (s.seats_purchased - t.included_seats) || ' seats)' as description,
  t.per_seat_price_cents as unit_amount,
  (s.seats_purchased - t.included_seats) as quantity,
  s.billing_cycle as period
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN tier_pricing t ON t.tier = s.tier
WHERE s.id = '${subscription_id}'
  AND s.seats_purchased > t.included_seats;
```

#### Usage-Based Items

```sql
-- Aggregate usage for billing period
SELECT
  ue.metric_name as description,
  SUM(ue.quantity) as quantity,
  ue.unit_price_cents as unit_amount,
  SUM(ue.total_price_cents) as total
FROM usage_events ue
WHERE ue.customer_id = '${customer_id}'
  AND ue.billed = false
  AND ue.recorded_at BETWEEN '${period_start}' AND '${period_end}'
GROUP BY ue.metric_name, ue.unit_price_cents;
```

### Phase 3: Tax Calculation

```sql
-- Determine tax requirements
SELECT
  o.country,
  o.state,
  o.tax_exempt,
  o.tax_id,
  CASE
    WHEN o.tax_exempt THEN 0
    WHEN o.country = 'US' THEN (
      SELECT rate FROM tax_rates
      WHERE country = 'US' AND state = o.state
    )
    WHEN o.country IN ('GB', 'DE', 'FR', ...) THEN (
      SELECT vat_rate FROM vat_rates WHERE country = o.country
    )
    ELSE 0
  END as tax_rate_percent
FROM organizations o
WHERE o.id = '${org_id}';
```
