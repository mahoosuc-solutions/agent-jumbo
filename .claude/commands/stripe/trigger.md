## Advantages Over Real Objects

**Speed**: Instant event triggering (vs creating real payments)

**Control**: Trigger exact events you want to test

**Clean**: No test data pollution in Stripe Dashboard

**Comprehensive**: Test edge cases (payment failures, etc.)

**Repeatable**: Trigger same event multiple times easily

## Related Commands

- `/stripe:listen` - Start webhook listener (required first)
- `/stripe:test-payment` - Create real test payment
- `/stripe:logs` - View Stripe API request logs

## Notes

**Listener Required**: Must have `/stripe:listen` running first

**Test Mode**: Only works in Stripe test mode

**Event Data**: Uses Stripe's sample event data (can override specific fields)
