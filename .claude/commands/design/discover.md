# PHASE 4: REQUIREMENTS GATHERING

Now let's translate pain points and workflows into specific requirements.

I'll guide you through creating user stories in the format:
**"As a [role], I want [action] so that [benefit]"**

---

### User Story Template

For each pain point and workflow bottleneck, we'll create user stories:

**User Story #1**:

```text
