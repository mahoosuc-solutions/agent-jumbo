# /design:solution - Create Solution Design

Create comprehensive technical solution designs with optional constitution-first governance for projects requiring structured decision frameworks and compliance validation.

## Overview

The `solution` command creates detailed solution designs using DEVB methodology:

- **Standard Mode**: Design → Emulate → Validate → Build workflow
- **Constitution-First Mode**: Constitution → Design → Spec-Kit Workflow → Build
- **From Existing Constitution**: Apply governance to new design

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Determine Design Approach

**Ask:** "How would you like to create this solution design?"

**Option A: Standard DEVB** (Default - Fast)

- Create design specification immediately
- No governance constraints
- Flexible architecture decisions
- **Use when**: Prototyping, MVPs, internal tools, experimental projects
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Option B: Constitution-First** (Recommended for Production)

- Define governance principles first
- Create design within constitution constraints
- Automatic compliance validation
- **Use when**: Production systems, regulated industries, team projects, client work
- **Time**: 15-25 minutes

**Option C: Use Existing Constitution**

- Apply existing governance framework
- Link design to constitution
- Inherit principles and constraints
- **Use when**: Adding features to existing system, organizational standards
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Step 2a: Standard DEVB Design Creation

**For Option A (Standard Mode):**

**2.1 Gather Requirements**

Ask user for design details:

**Problem Statement** (Required):
"What problem are you solving?" (1-3 sentences)

Example: "We need a real-time notification system that can handle 100k concurrent connections with <100ms latency for mobile app users."

**Functional Requirements** (Required):
"What must the system do?" (5-10 bullet points)

Example:

- Send push notifications to iOS and Android
- Support in-app notifications with read/unread status
- Enable email fallback for offline users
- Allow notification preferences per user
- Track delivery and open rates

**Non-Functional Requirements** (Required):
"What are the performance, security, and scalability needs?"

Example:

- Handle 100k concurrent WebSocket connections
- <100ms notification delivery (p95)
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive notifications
- GDPR compliance for user data

**Constraints** (Optional):
"Any technology or budget constraints?"

Example:

- Must use existing AWS infrastructure
- Max $5k/month infrastructure cost
- Support legacy REST API integration

**2.2 Create Design via API**

Call the design specification API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/design/specifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace_id": "{workspace_id}",
    "title": "{solution_title}",
    "description": "{problem_statement}",
    "requirements": {
      "functional": [{requirements_array}],
      "non_functional": [{nfr_array}],
      "constraints": [{constraints_array}]
    },
    "created_by": "{user_id}"
  }'
```

### Step 2b: Constitution-First Design Creation

**For Option B (Constitution-First):**

**2.1 Create Constitution Interactively**

Guide user through constitution creation:

**Project Overview:**

- Project name: "{name}"
- Description: "{1-2 sentence description}"
- Domain: api | event-driven | graphql | saas | mobile | general

**Core Principles** (3-5 principles):
Ask: "What are your core principles?"

Examples:

1. "Security First - All data encrypted, zero-trust architecture"
2. "Performance - API response time <200ms, 99.99% uptime"
3. "Developer Experience - Well-documented, easy to use APIs"
4. "Cost Efficiency - Optimize for <$10k/month infrastructure"
5. "Scalability - Horizontal scaling, 1M+ users supported"

**Constraints** (3-5 hard rules):
Ask: "What are your hard constraints?"

Examples:

1. "No direct database access from frontend" (architecture)
2. "All APIs must require authentication" (security)
3. "Data at rest must be encrypted with AES-256" (security)
4. "API response time must be <500ms p95" (performance)
5. "Use PostgreSQL for primary database" (technology)

**Quality Gates** (3-5 gates):
Ask: "What quality gates must be met?"

Examples:

1. "Test coverage >80%" (automated: yes)
2. "Zero critical security vulnerabilities" (automated: yes)
3. "API documentation coverage 100%" (automated: yes)
4. "Performance tests pass (load, stress, spike)" (automated: yes)
5. "Code review approved by 2+ engineers" (automated: no)

**Technology Stack:**
Ask: "What technologies are preferred/required?"

- Languages: TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, etc.
- Frameworks: React, Next.js, FastAPI, Express, etc.
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.

**2.2 Create Constitution via API**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/constitutions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "{project_name}",
    "description": "{description}",
    "principles": [
      {"title": "Security First", "description": "...", "priority": "must"},
      {"title": "Performance", "description": "...", "priority": "must"}
    ],
    "constraints": [
      {"category": "architecture", "rule": "...", "enforcement": "hard"},
      {"category": "security", "rule": "...", "enforcement": "hard"}
    ],
    "quality_gates": [
      {"name": "Test Coverage", "criteria": ">80%", "automated": true},
      {"name": "Security Scan", "criteria": "zero critical", "automated": true}
    ],
    "preferred_stack": {
      "languages": ["TypeScript", "Python"],
      "frameworks": ["Next.js", "FastAPI"],
      "databases": ["PostgreSQL", "Redis"],
      "cloud": ["AWS"]
    },
    "created_by": "{user_id}"
  }'
```

**2.3 Create Design with Constitution**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/with-constitution \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace_id": "{workspace_id}",
    "project_name": "{project_name}",
    "description": "{description}",
    "domain": "{domain}",
    "user_id": "{user_id}",
    "constitution_template": null
  }'
```

This will:

1. Create constitution first
2. Create design specification
3. Link constitution to design
4. Initialize spec-kit workflow
5. Return constitution ID, design ID, and workflow ID

### Step 2c: Use Existing Constitution

**For Option C (Existing Constitution):**

**2.1 List Available Constitutions**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/constitutions
```

Display:

```text
Available Constitutions:

1. const-abc-123: SaaS Best Practices
   - Principles: 5 (Security, Performance, Scalability, Developer Experience, Cost)
   - Constraints: 8 hard rules
   - Used by: 3 projects

2. const-def-456: Healthcare HIPAA Compliance
   - Principles: 6 (Patient Privacy, Data Security, Audit Trail, BAA, Encryption, Compliance)
   - Constraints: 12 hard rules
   - Used by: 2 projects

3. const-ghi-789: Fintech PCI-DSS
   - Principles: 7 (Payment Security, PCI Compliance, Fraud Detection, Encryption, Audit, SOC2, Zero Trust)
   - Constraints: 15 hard rules
   - Used by: 1 project
```

**2.2 Select Constitution**
Ask: "Which constitution would you like to use? (1-{count})"

**2.3 Create Design with Constitution**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/design/specifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace_id": "{workspace_id}",
    "title": "{solution_title}",
    "description": "{problem_statement}",
    "requirements": {...},
    "constitution_id": "{selected_constitution_id}",
    "created_by": "{user_id}"
  }'
```

Then link:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/constitutions/{constitution_id}/designs/{design_id}/link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "is_primary": true,
    "override_principles": []
  }'
```

   - Run /spec-kit:specify to create detailed specification

2. **Emulate Design** (if standard DEVB)
   - Test design before building

3. **Validate Design** (if standard DEVB)
   - AI validation from Security, Performance, Cost, UX perspectives

4. **Generate Specification**
   - Create comprehensive documentation

5. **View Constitution Details** (if linked)
   - See full governance framework

6. **Update Design**
   - Make changes to requirements or constraints

## Advanced Features

### Use Constitution Template

```bash
/design:solution "Project Name" --constitution-template saas
```

Use built-in template (saas, api, microservices, mobile, fintech, healthtech, ecommerce, event-driven, enterprise, startup).

API call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/constitutions/templates/saas/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Project Name",
    "description": "Description",
    "created_by": "user-id"
  }'
```

### Specify Domain for Better Defaults

```bash
/design:solution "API Gateway" --domain api
```

Domains: api, event-driven, graphql, saas, mobile, general

### Link Multiple Constitutions

```bash
/design:solution "Project" --constitution org-const-123 --constitution team-const-456
```

Apply organizational and team-level governance.

### Override Constitution Principles

```bash
/design:solution "Project" --constitution const-123 --override "Use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL"
```

Override specific principles while maintaining others.

## Error Handling

**If constitution not found:**

```text
❌ Constitution not found: {constitution_id}

Available constitutions:
1. const-abc-123: SaaS Best Practices
2. const-def-456: Healthcare HIPAA
3. const-ghi-789: Fintech PCI-DSS

Select one or create new:
  /spec-kit:constitution "New Constitution"
```

**If design creation fails:**

```text
❌ Design creation failed: {error_message}

Common causes:
1. Invalid workspace ID
2. Missing required fields
3. Database connection issue

Try:
1. Check workspace exists: /workspace/list
2. Simplify requirements and try again
3. Check backend logs: docker logs shopify-backend
```

**If constitution validation fails:**

```text
⚠️ Design violates constitution constraints

Constitution: {constitution_name}
Violations ({count}):
1. [CRITICAL] Using MySQL but PostgreSQL is required
2. [MAJOR] No encryption specified for data at rest
3. [MINOR] API response time target exceeds <500ms requirement

Would you like to:
1. Override violations (requires justification)
2. Update design to comply
3. Modify constitution constraints
```
