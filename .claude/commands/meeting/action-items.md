# Meeting Action Items - Intelligent Task Extraction & Assignment

## Overview

Meeting Action Items is an AI-powered system that automatically extracts commitments, tasks, and next steps from meeting notes, transcripts, or recordings. It assigns owners, suggests deadlines, prioritizes work, and integrates with your task management system to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

For solo entrepreneurs, meetings generate dozens of commitments weekly. This system ensures every "I'll do that by Friday" gets captured, assigned, tracked, and completed—transforming verbal commitments into executed work.

**ROI: $40,000/year** through eliminated dropped tasks (preventing 3-5 costly mistakes/year at $5-10K each), reduced meeting follow-up time (8 hours/month saved), improved team accountability, and faster project velocity from clear ownership.

## Key Benefits

**Zero Dropped Commitments**

- AI extracts 100% of action items from meeting discussions
- No reliance on manual note-taking or memory
- Captures implicit commitments ("let me check on that" = action item)
- Prevents costly mistakes from forgotten follow-ups

**Clear Accountability**

- Every action item has explicit owner (no ambiguity)
- Deadlines assigned or suggested based on context
- Priority levels guide work sequencing
- Dependencies identified to prevent blocked work

**Automated Task Management**

- Action items auto-exported to your task system (Asana, Todoist, etc.)
- Tracking integrated into existing workflow
- Reminders sent before deadlines
- Completion status synced back to meeting notes

**Team Visibility & Coordination**

- Everyone sees their commitments immediately after meeting
- Cross-functional dependencies surfaced
- Bottlenecks identified before they cause delays
- Progress visible to all stakeholders

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Provide Meeting Source Material

Action item extraction works from multiple input types:

```bash
# From meeting notes (most common)
/meeting:action-items --source meeting-notes --meeting "Board Meeting Q1 2024"

# From transcript (Zoom, Otter.ai, etc.)
/meeting:action-items --source transcript --file transcript.txt --meeting "Client Call - TechCorp"

# From recording with auto-transcription
/meeting:action-items --source recording --file meeting-recording.mp4 --auto-transcribe

# From rough notes or bullet points
/meeting:action-items --source notes --file rough-notes.md --meeting "Sprint Planning"

# Auto-assign based on participant roles and historical patterns
/meeting:action-items --meeting "Board Meeting Q1 2024" --auto-assign
```

The system will:

- Parse the source material (notes, transcript, recording)
- Identify explicit and implicit commitments
- Extract owner, deadline, and context for each action item
- Suggest priorities based on urgency and importance
- Flag dependencies between related action items
- Format for export to task management systems

### Step 2: Action Item Extraction Logic

AI identifies commitments using multiple patterns:

**Explicit Commitments:**

- "I'll [do X] by [deadline]"
- "Sarah will [task] before [date]"
- "We need to [action] by [time]"
- "Can you [request] this week?"
- "Let's [action] before next meeting"

**Implicit Commitments:**

- "Let me check on that" → [Person] check on [topic]
- "We should probably [action]" → Someone needs to [action]
- "I'll look into it" → [Person] research [topic]
- "Good point, I hadn't thought of that" → May imply follow-up action

**Questions Requiring Follow-Up:**

- "What's the status of [project]?" → [Owner] provide status update
- "Do we have data on [metric]?" → Someone gather data
- "Can we [capability]?" → Investigate feasibility

**Decisions Requiring Implementation:**

- "Let's go with option A" → Someone implement option A
- "Approved, move forward" → Project team execute plan
- "Hire for this role" → Someone start hiring process

**Meeting-End Commitments:**

- "I'll send the deck after this call" → [Person] send deck
- "Next steps are X, Y, Z" → Create actions for X, Y, Z
- "Let's schedule follow-up" → Someone schedule meeting

### Step 3: Automatic Owner Assignment

System assigns owners using multiple strategies:

**Explicit Assignment (Highest Confidence):**

- Direct statement: "Sarah, can you handle this?"
- Volunteering: "I'll take care of that"
- Role-based: "We need engineering to [task]" → Assign to engineering lead

**Role-Based Assignment (Medium Confidence):**

- Financial tasks → CFO or finance team
- Technical tasks → CTO or engineering lead
- Marketing tasks → VP Marketing or marketing team
- Sales tasks → Head of Sales or sales team

**Historical Pattern Assignment (Medium-Low Confidence):**

- Person who handled similar tasks in past meetings
- Person who raised the topic or concern
- Person with most context or expertise on the topic

**Default Assignment (Low Confidence):**

- If unclear, assign to meeting organizer or project lead
- Flag as "needs assignment" for manual review
- Suggest 2-3 potential owners based on analysis

**Example Extraction:**

```text
From Discussion:
"Michael brought up the churn concern. Sarah, can you pull together an analysis by cohort and present it at the next board meeting? We need to understand if this is a product issue, customer success issue, or sales qualification issue."

Extracted Action Item:
-----------------------
Task: Analyze customer churn by cohort and identify root cause patterns

Owner: Sarah Johnson (CFO)
Confidence: HIGH (explicit assignment)
Alternative: None

Deadline: April 15, 2024 (next board meeting)
Source: "present it at the next board meeting"
Confidence: HIGH (explicit deadline)

Priority: HIGH
Rationale:
- Board concern (requires leadership attention)
- Blocks Q2 strategic planning decisions
- Mentioned by board member (high-stakes stakeholder)

Dependencies:
- Access to customer data in Salesforce
- Potential need for engineering support on data extraction

Context:
Churn increased from 3.8% to 4.2% in Q1. Board member Michael Lee raised concern about sustainability. Analysis will inform whether Q2 should focus on customer success, sales qualification, or product improvements.

Deliverable Type: Analysis + Presentation
Estimated Effort: 8-12 hours
Skills Required: Data analysis, SQL, presentation
```

### Step 4: Deadline Extraction & Suggestion

System determines deadlines using multiple approaches:

**Explicit Deadlines (Use As-Is):**

- "By Friday" → This Friday's date
- "By next board meeting" → Next meeting date from calendar
- "In two weeks" → Date 14 days from meeting
- "End of quarter" → Last day of current quarter

**Relative Deadlines (Calculate Date):**

- "By next meeting" → Next scheduled meeting with same participants
- "Before Q2 starts" → March 31 if currently in Q1
- "This month" → Last day of current month
- "Soon" / "ASAP" → Suggest 3-5 business days

**Implied Deadlines (Infer from Context):**

- Mentioned during Q2 planning → Assume before Q2 ends
- Blocking other work → Urgent, suggest 1 week
- Board request → Due before next board meeting
- "No rush" → Suggest 2-4 weeks

**Default Deadlines (If No Signal):**

- High priority tasks: 1 week
- Medium priority tasks: 2 weeks
- Low priority tasks: 1 month
- Research/analysis: 2 weeks
- Quick follow-ups: 3-5 business days

### Step 5: Priority Assessment

Prioritize action items using multi-factor scoring:

**Priority Factors:**

1. **Stakeholder Importance (Weight: 30%)**
   - Board/investor request: +50 points
   - Customer request: +40 points
   - Internal leadership: +30 points
   - Team request: +20 points

2. **Urgency (Weight: 25%)**
   - Blocks other work: +50 points
   - Time-sensitive deadline: +40 points
   - "ASAP" or "urgent" mentioned: +35 points
   - Within 1 week: +30 points
   - Within 2 weeks: +20 points

3. **Business Impact (Weight: 25%)**
   - Revenue impact: +50 points
   - Customer retention impact: +45 points
   - Strategic decision dependency: +40 points
   - Team productivity impact: +30 points
   - Nice-to-have improvement: +10 points

4. **Effort vs. Value (Weight: 20%)**
   - High value, low effort (quick win): +50 points
   - High value, high effort (strategic): +40 points
   - Low value, low effort (easy): +20 points
   - Low value, high effort (avoid): +5 points

**Priority Scoring:**

- 80-100 points: **CRITICAL** (drop everything, do now)
- 60-79 points: **HIGH** (this week)
- 40-59 points: **MEDIUM** (this month)
- 20-39 points: **LOW** (backlog)
- 0-19 points: **OPTIONAL** (consider not doing)

**Example Priority Assessment:**

```text
Action Item: Analyze churn by cohort (Sarah)

Stakeholder Importance: Board request (+50) = 50 points
Urgency: Due at next board meeting in 5 weeks (+20) = 20 points
Business Impact: Strategic decision dependency (+40) = 40 points
Effort vs Value: High value, high effort (+40) = 40 points

Total Score: 150 points (weighted avg: 72 points)
Priority: HIGH

Justification:
Board-level concern with strategic implications for Q2 planning. Not time-critical (5 weeks out), but high value for decision-making. Effort is substantial (8-12 hours) but justified by impact.
```

### Step 6: Dependency Identification

Identify relationships between action items:

**Blocking Dependencies:**

- Task A must complete before Task B can start
- Example: "Hire engineer" blocks "Assign Slack integration"

**Information Dependencies:**

- Task A produces information needed for Task B
- Example: "Churn analysis" informs "Q2 customer success strategy"

**Resource Dependencies:**

- Task A and Task B require same person/resource
- Example: Both tasks assigned to Sarah (capacity constraint)

**Timeline Dependencies:**

- Task A and Task B must coordinate timing
- Example: "Send proposal" must happen before "Proposal presentation meeting"

**Decision Dependencies:**

- Task A requires decision to be made first
- Example: "Implement feature X" depends on "Decide to build vs buy"

**Example Dependency Graph:**

```text
Action Items from Sprint Planning Meeting:

1. [Chris] Complete onboarding wizard designs
   ↓ BLOCKS (design must finish before engineering)
2. [Jamie] Build onboarding wizard
   ↓ BLOCKS (feature must be ready before testing)
3. [Taylor] QA test onboarding wizard
   ↓ INFORMS (testing may reveal issues)
4. [Sarah] Update product roadmap with Q2 priorities
   (PARALLEL - no dependencies)

Dependencies Flagged:
- Task 2 cannot start until Task 1 completes (blocking)
- Task 3 cannot start until Task 2 completes (blocking)
- Task 4 is independent and can proceed immediately

Critical Path: 1 → 2 → 3 (Any delay cascades)
Parallel Work: Task 4 (no blockers, start immediately)

Capacity Conflict:
- Jamie assigned to Task 2 (onboarding) and also performance optimization
- Risk: 150% capacity allocation in Sprint 1
- Recommendation: Sequence tasks or add resources
```

### Step 7: Task Management Integration

Export action items to your preferred system:

**Supported Integrations:**

- **Asana**: Project-based task management with subtasks
- **Todoist**: Personal task lists with priorities and labels
- **Trello**: Kanban boards with cards and checklists

Discuss at next meeting: Executive Team Meeting (April 25)
```

### Step 10: Action Item Analytics

Track patterns and improve meeting effectiveness:

**Individual Performance Metrics:**

```text
Sarah Johnson - Action Item Analytics (Last 90 Days)

Total Action Items: 23
Completed: 21 (91% completion rate)
On Time: 19 (90% of completed items)
Average Time to Complete: 8.5 days (vs 10.2 day avg deadline)

Priority Breakdown:
- High priority: 8 items (100% completed, 88% on time)
- Medium priority: 12 items (92% completed, 92% on time)
- Low priority: 3 items (67% completed, 67% on time)

Pattern: Sarah completes high-priority items reliably but low-priority items sometimes slip. Consider: Don't assign low-priority items to Sarah if backlog is full.

Action Item Sources:
- Board meetings: 6 items (100% completion)
- Exec team meetings: 11 items (91% completion)
- Finance team meetings: 6 items (83% completion)

Average Effort Estimation Accuracy: 95%
(Estimated 8-12 hours, actual 10 hours avg)

Strengths:
- Reliable on strategic, high-impact items
- Accurate time estimates
- Proactive communication when blocked

Areas for Improvement:
- Low-priority items fall off radar (consider delegating)
- Occasionally misses soft deadlines without explicit date
```

**Meeting Effectiveness Metrics:**

```text
Board Meetings - Action Item Analytics (Last 12 Months)

Total Meetings: 4 (quarterly)
Action Items Generated: 47 (avg 11.8 per meeting)
Completion Rate: 89% (42 of 47 completed)
On-Time Rate: 85% (40 of 47 completed by deadline)

Action Item Trends:
- Q1 2023: 14 items (93% completion)
- Q2 2023: 10 items (90% completion)
- Q3 2023: 12 items (83% completion)
- Q4 2023: 11 items (91% completion)

Most Common Action Types:
1. Analysis/Research (14 items, 93% completion)
2. Strategic Planning (11 items, 91% completion)
3. Hiring/Personnel (8 items, 75% completion) ⚠ Lower completion
4. Communication/Updates (7 items, 100% completion)
5. Process Implementation (7 items, 86% completion)

Insights:
- Hiring-related action items have lower completion rate (75% vs 89% avg)
- May indicate hiring is harder than expected or timelines unrealistic
- Consider: Build more buffer time for hiring actions

Average Time from Assignment to Completion:
- High priority: 12 days
- Medium priority: 18 days
- Low priority: 31 days

Meeting Action Item Efficiency Score: 85/100
(Based on completion rate, on-time rate, and follow-through)

Recommendations:
- Reduce hiring action items per meeting (break into smaller milestones)
- Set more realistic deadlines for complex tasks
- Consider quarterly action item review (what's still open from 2+ meetings ago?)
```

## Best Practices

**Extract During Meeting, Not After**
If possible, use real-time extraction during meeting. As commitments are made, AI can surface action items immediately for confirmation. "Before we move on, let me confirm: Sarah, you'll analyze churn by April 15, correct?" This prevents post-meeting ambiguity.

**Confirm Ownership Explicitly**
When AI auto-assigns action items, send confirmation request to assignees within 1 hour. "You've been assigned 3 action items from today's board meeting. Please review and confirm or flag if anything is incorrect." Prevents "I didn't sign up for that" later.

**Use Template Action Item Language**
Train team to use consistent language for commitments: "I will [specific action] by [explicit deadline]." This makes extraction more accurate and reduces ambiguity. Share examples in meeting best practices doc.

**Limit Action Items Per Meeting**
More than 10-15 action items per meeting signals poor meeting focus or lack of prioritization. If extraction yields 20+ items, challenge whether all are truly necessary. Consider breaking into multiple meetings or deprioritizing lower-value work.

**Track Completion Rates by Person**
If someone consistently completes <80% of action items, investigate root cause. Are they over-assigned? Are deadlines unrealistic? Is the work unclear? Use data to improve assignment process, not to punish individuals.

**Escalate Blocked Items Quickly**
If action item is blocked >3 days, auto-escalate to meeting organizer or project lead. Blockers compound quickly—item blocked for 2 weeks often becomes crisis. Early escalation enables early intervention.

**Connect to Goals and Projects**
Tag action items with relevant goals, OKRs, or projects. This provides context (why this matters) and enables rollup reporting (which goals are progressing via action items completed?). Increases motivation and focus.

**Celebrate Completions**
When high-priority action items complete on time, acknowledge it. Send quick thanks or shout-out in Slack. Positive reinforcement increases future follow-through rates. Make accountability about praise for success, not punishment for failure.

## Success Criteria

**Extraction Accuracy:**

- 95%+ of action items correctly identified and extracted
- <5% false positives (non-action items mistakenly extracted)
- 90%+ owner assignment accuracy (verified by participants)
- 85%+ deadline extraction/inference accuracy

**Completion Rates:**

- 85%+ of extracted action items completed
- 80%+ completed by deadline (on-time completion)
- <10% of items remain open >30 days (stale items)
- <5% of items blocked >7 days without escalation

**Time Efficiency:**

- Action item extraction time: <5 minutes (vs 20-30 minutes manual)
- Export to task management: <2 minutes (automated)
- Participant confirmation: <5 minutes per person (quick review)
- Total time from meeting end to tracked actions: <15 minutes

**User Adoption:**

- 90%+ of team members using action item system consistently
- 85%+ satisfaction with accuracy and usefulness
- <10% manual corrections required per meeting
- Team prefers automated extraction over manual note-taking

**Business Impact:**

- Zero critical commitments dropped (prevented by systematic tracking)
- 2-3 costly mistakes avoided per year ($5-10K each) = $10-30K value
- 8-10 hours/month saved on manual action item tracking = $12K/year value
- Faster project velocity (reduced delays from unclear ownership)

## Common Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Board Meeting Action Items**
Extract commitments from quarterly board meetings where multiple strategic initiatives are discussed. Typical output: 8-15 action items across CEO, CFO, and board members. High-stakes items requiring tracking over 1-3 month timeframes. Critical for accountability and follow-through on board guidance.

**Use Case 2: Sprint Planning Follow-Ups**
Extract engineering tasks and assignments from sprint planning meetings. Connect to Linear or Jira for automatic ticket creation. Typical output: 10-20 engineering tasks with technical dependencies. Enables immediate sprint execution without manual ticket creation.

**Use Case 3: Client Sales Follow-Ups**
Extract next steps from sales discovery calls, demos, and proposal presentations. Typical output: 3-8 items (send proposal, schedule follow-up, intro to reference customer, technical deep-dive). Critical for sales velocity and preventing deals from stalling due to forgotten follow-ups.

**Use Case 4: Team Retrospective Action Items**
Extract process improvements and lessons learned from sprint or project retrospectives. Typical output: 5-10 process changes to implement. Track completion to ensure retrospectives lead to actual improvement, not just discussion.

**Use Case 5: Partnership Negotiation Action Items**
Extract deliverables and next steps from multi-meeting partnership negotiations. Typical output: 4-8 items per meeting across technical integration, legal review, go-to-market planning. Long timeline (weeks to months) requires systematic tracking to maintain momentum.

**Use Case 6: Investor Update Follow-Ups**
Extract commitments from monthly or quarterly investor update calls. Typical output: 3-6 follow-ups (send metrics update, intro to potential customer, provide feedback on pitch deck). Maintains investor relationship through consistent follow-through.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: AI extracts too many false positives (non-action items)**

- Solution: Tune confidence threshold higher. Only extract items with explicit commitment language or clear owner assignment. Flag low-confidence items for manual review rather than auto-creating tasks.

**Problem: Action items assigned to wrong person**

- Solution: Build participant role profiles (CFO handles finance, CTO handles tech). Use historical assignment patterns from previous meetings. Allow manual override during confirmation phase before export.

**Problem: Deadlines inferred incorrectly**

- Solution: Be conservative with deadline inference. If unclear, suggest 2-week default and flag for manual review. Train team to use explicit deadline language ("by Friday" not "soon").

**Problem: Too many action items generated (overwhelming)**

- Solution: Apply minimum priority threshold (only extract medium+ priority items). Or extract all but separate into "must do" vs "nice to have" categories. Consider whether meeting itself needs better focus.

**Problem: Action items not getting completed despite tracking**

- Solution: Investigate root cause. Are items poorly defined? Deadlines unrealistic? People over-assigned? Use completion analytics to identify pattern and fix process, not just track harder.

**Problem: Extraction misses implicit commitments**

- Solution: Expand extraction patterns to include questions ("do we have data on X?" = action to gather data), concerns raised ("I'm worried about Y" = action to address concern), and discussion gaps ("we should discuss Z" = action to schedule discussion).

**Problem: Integration with task system failing or manual**

- Solution: Use API integrations where available (Asana, Todoist, Jira APIs). If not available, export to CSV or JSON for bulk import. Last resort: Email formatted task list for manual entry (still faster than extracting manually).
