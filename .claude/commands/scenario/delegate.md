# /scenario:delegate - Delegate Scenario Analysis

Assign a scenario analysis task to a team member with clear expectations and deadlines. The team member receives a notification and can track progress through their delegation dashboard.

## Quick Start

**Delegate scenario to team member:**

```bash
/scenario:delegate sc-1733596400000-abc123 --to john@company.com
```

**Add deadline and notes:**

```bash
/scenario:delegate sc-1733596400000-abc123 --to john@company.com --due 2025-12-20 --notes "Focus on financial impact analysis"
```

**List all delegations assigned by you:**

```bash
/scenario:delegate --list-mine
```

**List delegations assigned to you:**

```bash
/scenario:delegate --list-for-me
```

**Check status of a delegation:**

```bash
/scenario:delegate sc-1733596400000-abc123 --status
```

---

## How Delegation Works

### Step 1: Select Scenario and Assignee

Choose which scenario needs analysis and who should analyze it.

### Step 2: Set Expectations

Define:

- **Deadline** (optional): When analysis should be complete
- **Notes** (optional): Specific guidance or focus areas
- **Deliverable**: Recommendation with supporting evidence

### Step 3: Notify Assignee

Team member receives email notification with:

- Scenario summary
- Analysis requirements
- Deadline (if set)
- Link to scenario details

### Step 4: Assignee Works

Team member:

- Views scenario details and parameters
- Runs analysis using slash commands
- Collects evidence and metrics
- Documents findings

### Step 5: Submit & Review

Team member submits deliverable:

- Recommendation (which scenario)
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Supporting evidence
- Key findings

### Step 6: Manager Approves

Manager reviews and:

- **Approves** - Accept recommendation and make decision
- **Requests Changes** - Ask for more analysis
- **Rejects** - Suggest different approach

### Step 7: Decision

Manager makes final decision using `/scenario:decide` with delegation input

## Delegation Status Workflow

```text
ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → APPROVED
                         ↓
                      REJECTED (restart analysis)
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Who Can Change |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **assigned** | Waiting for assignee to start | Assignee (→ in_progress) |
| **in_progress** | Analysis underway | Assignee (→ review) |
| **review** | Submitted for approval | Manager (→ approved/rejected) |
| **approved** | Manager accepted analysis | End state |
| **rejected** | Manager wants more work | Assignee (→ in_progress) |
