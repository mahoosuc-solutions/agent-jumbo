# /scenario:workflow - Run Strategic Workflow

Run a pre-built decision workflow to automatically create scenarios, collect inputs, analyze options, and get recommendations. Workflows handle complete decision analysis in minutes instead of hours.

## Quick Start

**List all available workflows:**

```bash
/scenario:workflow --list
```

**Run a specific workflow:**

```bash
/scenario:workflow hire-vs-outsource
```

**Run workflow with pre-filled inputs:**

```bash
/scenario:workflow hire-vs-outsource --inputs '{"role":"Senior Developer","hours_needed":40,"duration_months":12}'
```

**Run workflow and auto-analyze:**

```bash
/scenario:workflow buy-property --auto-run
```

## How Workflows Work

### Step 1: Select Workflow

Choose from available workflows or specify a workflow ID.

### Step 2: Answer Input Questions

The workflow will ask for specific inputs relevant to your decision:

- **Hire-vs-Outsource**: Role, hours needed, duration, salary, agency rate
- **Buy-Property**: Property details, pricing, expected income
- **Take-Project**: Project details, revenue, time, strategic value

### Step 3: Automatic Scenario Creation

The workflow automatically:

- Creates 2-3 scenarios based on the template
- Populates parameters with your inputs
- Registers both scenarios in the system

### Step 4: Run Analysis

Each scenario is analyzed using integrated slash commands:

- Calculates alignment scores
- Detects conflicts
- Generates recommendations
- Produces metrics (pros/cons/risks/opportunities)

### Step 5: Get Comparison & Recommendation

Results include:

- Side-by-side scenario comparison
- Overall recommendation with confidence score
- Decision logic explaining the recommendation
- Next steps guidance

```

### Export Results

After workflow completes, export to file:

```bash
/scenario:workflow hire-vs-outsource > workflow-results.txt
```

### Compare with Different Inputs

Run workflow multiple times with different assumptions:
