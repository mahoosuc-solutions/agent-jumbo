========================================

✅ DECISION: Hire Full-Time Developer

Confidence Level: 82%

========================================
RATIONALE
========================================

Why This Choice:
"Higher long-term value and team morale boost. Financial ROI strong at 12-month mark."

Financial Analysis:
- Year 1 Cost: $100,000
- Year 1 Revenue Impact: +$160,000

- Decision: Worth the investment

Strategic Analysis:
- Supports Business Growth: ✅ Excellent alignment
- Team Building: ✅ Morale boost (+10)
- Long-term Scalability: ✅ Enables future hiring
- Reduces Dependency: ✅ Less reliant on freelancers

Alternative Considered (Outsourcing):
- Cost savings in Year 1: $48K less
- Quality concerns: -20% expected output
- Less strategic value: No team building
- Less flexible: Can't scale team easily
- Rejected because: Strategic value doesn't justify cost savings

Risk Mitigation:
- Risk: Wrong hire / poor fit
  Mitigation: Structured interviews, probation period, clear KPIs

- Risk: Not enough work to keep busy
  Mitigation: 40+ hours booked before hiring

- Risk: Salary expectations increase
  Mitigation: Clear compensation structure in offer
