## Best Practices

1. **Research the Company Deeply** - Spend 30 minutes researching before writing. Reference specific details that show genuine interest and preparation.

2. **Lead with Your Strongest Achievement** - Put your most impressive, relevant accomplishment in the first body paragraph to hook the reader immediately.

3. **Use the STAR Method Consistently** - Every achievement should follow Situation-Task-Action-Result structure for maximum impact and clarity.

4. **Customize Everything** - Generic cover letters are worse than no cover letter. Every sentence should be specific to this job at this company.

5. **Show, Don't Tell** - Instead of "I'm a great leader," write "I led a team of 8 engineers to deliver a product that increased revenue by 25%."

6. **Match Their Language** - Use terminology from the job posting. If they say "customer success," don't say "client satisfaction."

7. **Address the Hiring Manager by Name** - Research to find the hiring manager's name. "Dear Hiring Manager" is acceptable only as last resort.

8. **Keep It Concise** - Hiring managers spend 30 seconds on cover letters. Make every word count. Aim for 300-400 words maximum.

9. **Proofread Obsessively** - One typo can eliminate you from consideration. Read aloud, use spell-check, have someone else review.

10. **Create Multiple Versions** - Develop 2-3 templates for different types of roles, then customize heavily for each specific application.

## Integration Points

- **Resume Optimizer** (`/resume/optimize`) - Ensure cover letter reinforces resume highlights
- **LinkedIn Profile** (`/resume/linkedin`) - Maintain consistent professional narrative
- **Portfolio** (`/resume/portfolio`) - Reference portfolio projects when relevant
- **Company Research Tools** - Integrate LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and company website insights

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Cover letter sounds generic despite customization attempts

**Issue**: Struggling to explain career gap or transition

- **Solution**: Keep explanation brief (2-3 sentences), focus on what you gained during gap/transition, redirect to enthusiasm for target role

**Issue**: Cover letter too long (over one page)

- **Solution**: Eliminate weakest achievement paragraph, tighten language (remove adjectives, use active voice), focus on 2-3 strongest points only

**Issue**: Unsure about appropriate tone for company culture

- **Solution**: Review company's social media, blog posts, and job posting language. Match their communication style. When uncertain, err toward professional formality.

**Issue**: Can't find hiring manager name

- **Solution**: Check LinkedIn, company website, call company reception. If unavailable, use "Dear [Department] Hiring Team" rather than generic "To Whom It May Concern"
