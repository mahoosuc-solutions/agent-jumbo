## Best Practices

1. **Always Create Job-Specific Versions** - Never use a generic resume for multiple applications. Each job deserves a tailored version optimizing for that specific posting.

2. **Prioritize Keyword Integration Over Density** - Focus on naturally incorporating required keywords rather than hitting arbitrary density targets. ATS systems penalize keyword stuffing.

3. **Lead with Impact, Not Responsibilities** - Every bullet point should demonstrate value delivered, not just tasks performed. Use STAR method consistently.

4. **Maintain ATS and Human Readability** - While optimizing for ATS, ensure the resume remains compelling for human recruiters who review it after ATS passage.

5. **Use Industry-Standard Section Headings** - Stick with "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills" rather than creative alternatives that confuse ATS parsers.

6. **Quantify Everything Possible** - Add metrics, percentages, dollar amounts, time frames, team sizes, and scale indicators wherever possible.

7. **Keep Formatting Simple in ATS Version** - Use standard fonts, simple bullets, no columns, and avoid headers/footers. Create a separate visual version for in-person interviews.

8. **Front-Load Important Information** - Put most relevant experience and keywords in the top half of the first page where recruiters spend most attention.

9. **Test Against Multiple ATS Systems** - Different systems have different parsing capabilities. Test with tools like Jobscan or Resume Worded before submission.

10. **Update for Each Application Round** - As you gain new experience or receive feedback, continuously improve your base resume and customization approach.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Low keyword match score despite relevant experience

- **Solution**: Job requirements may use different terminology. Look for synonyms and industry-specific terms. Example: "customer success" vs "client relations"

**Issue**: ATS formatting score is low

- **Solution**: Export resume as plain text to see how ATS sees it. Simplify formatting, remove tables/graphics, use standard section headings

**Issue**: Resume too long after adding keywords

- **Solution**: Remove older/less relevant positions, consolidate similar roles, eliminate low-impact bullets, use more concise language

**Issue**: Optimization feels inauthentic or keyword-stuffed

- **Solution**: Focus on naturally integrating keywords into genuine accomplishments. If you don't have the skill, consider removing it rather than forcing it

**Issue**: Different ATS systems give different results

- **Solution**: Create a maximally compatible version that works across all systems, then test and adjust for specific high-priority applications
