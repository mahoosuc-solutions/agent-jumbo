# Create New Business Context

Set up a new business context with guided configuration, templates, and automatic integration setup.

## What This Command Does

Quickly establish a new business context with everything you need:

- **Guided Setup**: Step-by-step interactive configuration
- **Templates**: Pre-built context structures for common business types
- **Integration Ready**: Automatic Zoho CRM, Google Calendar, and other setup
- **Data Structure**: Automatic folder and file creation
- **Quick Mode**: Fast setup for experienced users (--quick flag)
- **Validation**: Automatic checks to ensure valid configuration

## Why This Matters for Growing Operators

As you add new properties, clients, or projects, you need a fast way to set up new contexts:

- Don't manually create folders and configs
- Don't forget to connect integrations
- Don't lose time on setup - get productive in minutes
- Don't miss critical configuration steps

**Time Saved**: 15-30 minutes per new context setup (vs manual approach)

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive guided setup for new property
/context:create my-new-property --type property

# Create using template with prompts
/context:create client-xyz --type consulting --template consulting

# Fast setup for experienced users
/context:create rental-unit-5 --type property --quick

# Personal finance context
/context:create personal-finances --type personal

# Startup project context
/context:create saas-alpha --type startup --template startup

# From existing context (copy and modify)
/context:create project-2 --type startup --from startup-project
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Validate Context Name

```bash
# Check name format and uniqueness
if [[ ! $context_name =~ ^[a-z0-9-]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Invalid name. Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens."
  exit 1
fi

if [ -f ~/.claude/contexts/${context_name}.json ]; then
  echo "Context already exists!"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Determine Context Type

```bash
# If not specified, ask user
# If --type specified, validate
# If --template specified, infer type from template
```

### 3. Load Template

```bash
# Load base template for type
# If --from specified, use existing context as base
# Apply any customizations from arguments
```

### 4. Interactive Configuration (unless --quick)

```bash
# Present questions in order:
# 1. Business name / Description
# 2. Location / Geographic details
# 3. Financial setup (currency, tax rate, etc)
# 4. Integration preferences
# 5. Initial data
```

### 5. Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create home directory: ~/[category]/[context-name]/
# Create subdirectories based on type
# Initialize empty files for key documents
```

### 6. Create Context File

```bash
# Save to ~/.claude/contexts/${context_name}.json
# Include all configuration and metadata
# Set timestamps and status
```

### 7. Setup Integrations

```bash
# For each enabled integration:
# - Create entry in Zoho CRM
# - Create Google Calendar
# - Create QuickBooks account structure
# - Configure API connections
```

### 8. Generate Initial Todo

```bash
# Create context-specific todo list
# Based on type (properties need tenant setup, consulting needs contract setup, etc)
# Mark as pending
```

### 9. Confirm and Offer Next Steps

```bash
# Show summary of what was created
# Offer to switch to new context immediately
# Suggest typical next actions for this context type
```

## Context File Structure

```json
{
  "name": "context-name",
  "id": "CTX-00001",
  "type": "property|consulting|startup|personal",
  "business_name": "Full Business Name",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "created": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "last_active": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "status": "active|paused|archived",
  "location": {
    "address": "street address",
    "city": "city",
    "state": "state",
    "country": "country",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago"
  },
  "state": {
    "environment_vars": {},
    "active_projects": [],
    "open_files": [],
    "todo_list": [],
    "notes": ""
  },

  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_by": "user",
    "version": "1.0",
    "folder_structure": []
  }
}
```
