# Context Switching for Multi-Business Management

Switch seamlessly between different business contexts without losing state or progress.

## What This Command Does

Manage multiple businesses, properties, or client projects by switching entire operational contexts:

- **Save Current State**: Automatically save all open work before switching
- **Load New Context**: Restore environment, variables, and active work
- **Context Isolation**: Keep business data separated
- **Quick Switching**: Switch in <5 seconds with full state restoration

## Why This Matters for Solo Entrepreneurs

Managing multiple properties, consulting clients, or business units requires constant context switching. Traditional approaches lose 20-30 minutes per switch. This command makes it instant.

**Time Saved**: 10-15 hours/week for operators managing 3+ businesses

## Usage

```bash
# Switch to property management context
/context:switch property-management

# Switch to consulting client with state save
/context:switch client-acme --save-current

# Switch and load full environment state
/context:switch rental-portfolio --load-state

# Quick switch without saving
/context:switch startup-project
```

## Context Structure

Each context stores:

```json
{
  "name": "property-management",
  "type": "business",
  "created": "2025-01-15",
  "last_active": "2025-01-20T14:30:00Z",
  "state": {
    "active_projects": ["123-main-st-maintenance", "lease-renewal-march"],
    "open_files": ["/properties/123-main-st/lease.pdf"],
    "environment_vars": {
      "BUSINESS_NAME": "Main Street Properties LLC",
      "ZOHO_CRM_ID": "12345",
      "PRIMARY_LOCATION": "Austin, TX"
    },
    "active_commands": ["/sales:pipeline", "/finance:report"],
    "todo_list": [...],
    "notes": "Roof repair scheduled for Feb 1"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "zoho_crm": "enabled",
    "google_calendar": "enabled",
    "quickbooks": "enabled"
  }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Save Current Context State

```bash
# Capture current working state
- Active files and cursor positions
- Environment variables
- Open terminal sessions
- In-progress commands
- Todo list state
- Recent command history
```

### 2. Validate Target Context

```bash
# Check if context exists
if [ -f ~/.claude/contexts/${context_name}.json ]; then
  echo "Loading existing context: $context_name"
else
  echo "Context not found. Create new? (y/n)"
fi
```

### 3. Load Context Configuration

```bash
# Read context configuration
CONTEXT_FILE=~/.claude/contexts/${context_name}.json
BUSINESS_NAME=$(jq -r '.state.environment_vars.BUSINESS_NAME' $CONTEXT_FILE)
ZOHO_CRM_ID=$(jq -r '.state.environment_vars.ZOHO_CRM_ID' $CONTEXT_FILE)
```

### 4. Restore Environment State

- Set environment variables for the business
- Navigate to primary working directory
- Restore open files and cursor positions
- Reconnect to relevant databases/APIs

### 5. Load Active Work

- Restore todo list for this context
- Load recent notes and context
- Show active projects and deadlines
- Display recent command history

### 6. Initialize Context Dashboard

**Backup**: All context states are automatically backed up every 30 minutes to prevent data loss.

**Sync**: Contexts can sync across devices via encrypted cloud storage for mobile/desktop continuity.
