### Step 3: Craft the Hook (First 3-8 Seconds)

Create attention-grabbing openings:

**Hook Types:**

1. **Question Hook**: "What if I told you that 90% of businesses are wasting money on..."
2. **Statistic Hook**: "In the next 60 seconds, 3,000 people will make this costly mistake..."
3. **Bold Statement**: "Everything you know about marketing is wrong."
4. **Story Hook**: "Three months ago, I was broke. Today, I'll show you what changed..."
5. **Pattern Interrupt**: "Stop scrolling. This will save you thousands of dollars."
6. **Curiosity Gap**: "The secret ingredient that millionaires don't want you to know..."
7. **Relatable Problem**: "Tired of wasting hours on content that gets zero engagement?"

**Hook Formula:**

```text
[ATTENTION GRABBER] + [BENEFIT PREVIEW] + [TIMEFRAME]

Example: "In the next 90 seconds, I'll show you the exact formula that
grew our YouTube channel from 0 to 100k subscribers in 6 months."
```

### Step 4: Structure the Main Content

Organize content for maximum retention:

**YouTube Long-Form Structure:**

```text
[0:00-0:08] Hook
[0:08-0:30] Introduction + credibility
[0:30-1:00] Preview of what's covered
[1:00-8:00] Main content (3-5 major points)
  - Point 1 [1:00-2:30]
  - Point 2 [2:30-4:00]
  - Point 3 [4:00-6:00]
  - Point 4 [6:00-7:30]
[7:30-8:00] Summary + CTA
[8:00-8:20] Outro + end screen
```

**TikTok/Short-Form Structure:**

```text
[0:00-0:02] Visual hook
[0:02-0:05] Verbal hook + promise
[0:05-0:45] Rapid delivery of value
  - 3-5 quick tips/points
  - Visual variety every 3-5 seconds
[0:45-0:60] Payoff + CTA + loop
```

**Corporate Training Structure:**

```text
[0:00-0:30] Learning objectives
[0:30-1:00] Why this matters
[1:00-8:00] Step-by-step instruction
  - Concept explanation
  - Demonstration
  - Practice guidance
[8:00-9:00] Summary + next steps
[9:00-10:00] Resources + Q&A
```

### Step 5: Add B-Roll and Visual Notes

Annotate every section with visual guidance:

**B-Roll Categories:**

- **Illustrative**: Graphics, animations, diagrams
- **Demonstrative**: Screen recordings, product demos
- **Supportive**: Stock footage, relevant imagery
- **Emotional**: Reaction shots, lifestyle footage
- **Transitional**: Motion graphics, scene changes

**Annotation Format:**

```yaml
SCRIPT: "The first step is to identify your target audience."

[B-ROLL: Graph animation showing audience segmentation]
[SCREEN: Highlight demographic data on dashboard]
[TEXT OVERLAY: "Know Your Audience"]
[MUSIC: Upbeat, energetic - fade under dialogue]

SCRIPT: "This changed everything for our business."

[B-ROLL: Before/after comparison shots]
[TRANSITION: Quick zoom effect]
[SOUND EFFECT: Whoosh transition]
```

### Step 6: Insert Timing and Pacing Markers

Add production timing guidance:

**Marker Types:**

- `[00:00]` - Timestamp markers
- `[PAUSE 2 SEC]` - Silence for emphasis
- `[QUICK CUT]` - Fast transition
- `[SLOW REVEAL]` - Gradual visual reveal
- `[BEAT DROP]` - Music synchronization point
- `[TEXT ON SCREEN: 3 SEC]` - Text display duration
- `[PATTERN INTERRUPT]` - Retention technique

**Pacing Guidelines:**

- **Fast-paced**: 150-180 words per minute (TikTok, Reels)
- **Medium-paced**: 130-150 words per minute (YouTube)
- **Slow-paced**: 110-130 words per minute (Corporate, Educational)

### Step 7: Optimize for Engagement and Retention

Apply retention techniques:

**Pattern Interrupts (Every 20-30 seconds):**

- Visual changes (zoom, pan, cut)
- Tone/energy shifts
- Direct address to viewer
- Questions or challenges
- Unexpected statements
- Graphics or text overlays

**Engagement Triggers:**

- **Call-to-Action**: "Comment below if you agree"
- **Poll/Question**: "Which option would you choose?"
- **Challenge**: "Try this and let me know what happens"
- **Teaser**: "But wait, there's something even better coming..."
- **Cliffhanger**: "And the most important tip is... [next section]"

**Retention Strategies:**

- Open loops (promises to be fulfilled later)
- Progress indicators ("3 more tips to go")
- Value stacking ("And it gets even better")
- Curiosity gaps
- Story continuation

### Step 8: Add Call-to-Action Placement

Strategically place CTAs:

**Primary CTA Positions:**

- **Early CTA** (0:20-0:40): Subscribe/Follow for more
- **Mid-Roll CTA** (50% mark): Like if you're finding this valuable
- **Pre-Close CTA** (80% mark): Main conversion action
- **End CTA** (final 10 seconds): Multiple options

**CTA Types:**

- **Engagement**: Like, comment, share, subscribe
- **Conversion**: Visit website, download resource, book call
- **Navigation**: Watch next video, check playlist
- **Community**: Join group, follow on other platforms
- **Transaction**: Buy product, enroll in course

**CTA Formulation:**

```text
[SPECIFIC ACTION] + [CLEAR BENEFIT] + [URGENCY/SCARCITY]

Example: "Click the link below to download the free checklist
before we close access at midnight tonight."
```
