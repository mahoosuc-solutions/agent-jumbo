Extract product data from solution folder: **${ARGUMENTS}**

## Product Extraction from AI Solution Folders

**Intelligent Data Extraction** - Parse completion reports, campaign files, and templates
**Metrics Extraction** - Quality scores, ROI, time savings, cost savings
**Structured Output** - JSON ready for `/product:define --from-solution`
**Quality Validation** - Verify extracted data completeness and accuracy

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Validate Solution Folder

Parse folder path from arguments:

```javascript
const args = parseArguments(ARGUMENTS)
const folderPath = args.positional[0]
const savePath = args['--save-to'] || `${folderPath}/extracted-product-definition.json`
```

Validate folder exists and contains expected structure:

- ✓ Completion reports (WEEK-*-COMPLETION-REPORT.md)
- ✓ README.md or campaign README
- ✓ Strategy files (strategy/*.md) OR templates/*.md
- ✓ Campaign output files (creative/*.md, gtm-plan/*.md)

If folder doesn't exist or is missing critical files, show error and suggest valid paths.

### Step 2: Extract Metrics from Completion Reports

**Priority 1: Completion Reports** (highest quality data source)

Search for completion reports:

```bash
find ${folderPath} -type f -name "*WEEK*COMPLETION*REPORT*.md" -o -name "*completion*report*.md"
```

For each completion report found, extract:

**Quality Metrics**:

- Quality Score: Look for patterns like "Quality: XX/100", "Score: XX%", "Quality Assessment: XX.X/100"
- Extract numeric value (e.g., "93.3/100" → 93.3)

**Time Savings**:

- Manual time: Look for "Manual: XX hours", "Without AI: XX-XX hours"
- AI time: Look for "AI-powered: XX minutes", "With AI: XX-XX minutes"
- Percentage: Look for "XX% faster", "XX% time reduction"
- Format as: "31-45 hours manual → 15-20 min AI (93-96% reduction)"

**Cost Savings**:

- Look for dollar amounts: "$X,XXX saved", "Cost reduction: $X,XXX-X,XXX"
- Extract range if present (e.g., "$4,300-6,200")
- Format as: "$4,300-6,200 per campaign"

**ROI Metrics**:

- Look for "ROAS: X.Xx", "ROI: XX:1", "Return: Xx multiplier"
- Extract numeric value (e.g., "3.5x ROAS" → "3.5x ROAS")

If multiple completion reports exist, use the most recent (highest WEEK number).

### Step 3: Extract Product Overview from README

**Priority 2: README.md** (product name, description, overview)

Find README:

```bash
# Check campaign folder first
find ${folderPath} -type f -name "README.md" -o -name "readme.md" | head -1
```

Extract:

**Product Name**:

- Look for title (# heading) or "Product:" or "Campaign:" labels
- Clean formatting (remove markdown, extra spaces)
- Example: "# AI Email Assistant Campaign" → "AI Email Assistant"

**Product Description**:

- Extract first 2-3 paragraphs after title
- Look for "Overview", "What is", "About" sections
- Limit to 300-500 characters
- Remove markdown formatting

**Key Features**:

- Look for "Features", "Key Features", "Capabilities", "What it does" sections
- Extract bullet points or numbered lists
- Limit to top 5-7 features
- Format as array: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", ...]

### Step 4: Extract Target Audience from Strategy Files

**Priority 3: Strategy Files** (target audience, personas, positioning)

Search for strategy files:

```bash
find ${folderPath} -type f -path "*/strategy/*.md"
```

Extract from these files:

**Target Audience** (from `01-target-audience.md` or similar):

- Look for "Persona", "Target Market", "Ideal Customer" sections
- Extract:
  - Primary Persona (role, company size, industry)
  - Pain Points (top 3-5 problems they face)
  - Goals (what they want to achieve)
- Format as structured object

**Value Proposition** (from `02-value-proposition.md` or similar):

- Look for "Unique Value", "Key Benefits", "Why Choose Us" sections
- Extract main value statement (1-2 sentences)
- Extract top 3 benefits with metrics if available

**Positioning** (from `03-positioning.md` or similar):

- Look for positioning statement
- Competitive advantages
- Differentiation points

If strategy files don't exist, fall back to template analysis (next step).

### Step 5: Extract Capabilities from Templates

**Priority 4: Templates** (for agent-based products)

Search for template/agent definition files:

```bash
find ${folderPath} -type f -path "*/templates/*.md" -o -path "*/*agent*.md"
```

Extract:

**Agent Capabilities**:

- Look for "CAPABILITIES", "FEATURES", "WHAT IT DOES" sections
- Extract bullet points
- Map to product features

**Technical Specifications**:

- Input/Output formats
- Integration points
- Performance characteristics

**Use Cases**:

- Look for "EXAMPLES", "USE CASES", "SCENARIOS" sections
- Extract specific use case descriptions

### Step 6: Identify Product Type

Determine product category based on extracted data:

**SaaS Product** (if):

- Recurring pricing model mentioned
- Web/cloud-based delivery
- Subscription language ("monthly", "annual", "plans")
- Keywords: "dashboard", "platform", "tool", "software"

**E-commerce Product** (if):

- One-time purchase
- Physical or digital goods
- Shopping/cart language
- Keywords: "buy", "shop", "order", "product catalog"

**B2B Service** (if):

- Consultation/coaching mentioned
- Professional services
- Custom/enterprise solutions
- Keywords: "consulting", "implementation", "strategy", "done-for-you"

**Digital Product** (if):

- Templates, courses, guides
- One-time download
- Educational content
- Keywords: "template", "guide", "course", "framework"

### Step 7: Generate Pricing Recommendations

Based on extracted ROI and value metrics, suggest pricing:

**Calculation Logic**:

1. If cost savings extracted (e.g., "$4,300-6,200"):
   - Suggest pricing at 10-20% of cost savings
   - Example: $4,300 savings → Price at $430-860/month

2. If time savings extracted (e.g., "45 hours saved"):
   - Assume $100/hour value
   - 45 hours × $100 = $4,500 value
   - Price at 10-20% → $450-900/month

3. If ROI extracted (e.g., "3.5x ROAS"):
   - Suggest pricing that maintains 2x+ ROI for customer
   - Example: If customer spends $1000, gets $3,500 return
   - Product can be priced up to $1,750 while maintaining 2x ROI

**Pricing Tiers** (recommend 3-tier structure):

- **Starter**: 60% of calculated price (entry point)
- **Pro**: 100% of calculated price (primary offering)
- **Enterprise**: 200-300% of calculated price (custom features)

### Step 8: Synthesize into Product Definition JSON

## Extraction Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Quality Score Extraction

```javascript
function extractQualityScore(completionReportText) {
  // Patterns to match
  const patterns = [
    /quality[:\s]+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*\/\s*100/i,
    /score[:\s]+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*%/i,
    /(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*\/\s*100\s+quality/i,
    /quality assessment[:\s]+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)/i
  ]

  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = completionReportText.match(pattern)
    if (match) {
      return {
        score: parseFloat(match[1]),
        source: `Line ${getLineNumber(match.index)}`
      }
    }
  }

  return { score: null, source: "Not found" }
}
```

### Algorithm 2: Time Savings Extraction

```javascript
function extractTimeSavings(completionReportText) {
  // Look for time comparisons
  const manualTimePattern = /(?:manual|without AI|traditional)[:\s]+(\d+(?:-\d+)?)\s*hours?/i
  const aiTimePattern = /(?:AI|automated|with AI)[:\s]+(\d+(?:-\d+)?)\s*(?:min(?:ute)?s?|hours?)/i
  const percentPattern = /(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*%\s*(?:faster|time reduction|time saved)/i

  const manualMatch = completionReportText.match(manualTimePattern)
  const aiMatch = completionReportText.match(aiTimePattern)
  const percentMatch = completionReportText.match(percentPattern)

  let result = ""

  if (manualMatch && aiMatch) {
    result = `${manualMatch[1]} hours manual → ${aiMatch[1]} AI`
  }

  if (percentMatch) {
    result += ` (${percentMatch[1]}% reduction)`
  }

  return result || "Not found"
}
```

### Algorithm 3: Product Type Detection

```javascript
function detectProductType(folderContents) {
  const allText = folderContents.join(' ').toLowerCase()

  // Scoring system
  const scores = {
    saas: 0,
    ecommerce: 0,
    service: 0,
    digital: 0
  }

  // SaaS indicators
  if (allText.includes('subscription') || allText.includes('monthly') || allText.includes('saas')) {
    scores.saas += 3
  }
  if (allText.includes('dashboard') || allText.includes('platform') || allText.includes('app')) {
    scores.saas += 2
  }

  // E-commerce indicators
  if (allText.includes('shopping') || allText.includes('cart') || allText.includes('checkout')) {
    scores.ecommerce += 3
  }
  if (allText.includes('product catalog') || allText.includes('inventory')) {
    scores.ecommerce += 2
  }

  // Service indicators
  if (allText.includes('consulting') || allText.includes('implementation') || allText.includes('done-for-you')) {
    scores.service += 3
  }
  if (allText.includes('strategy') || allText.includes('coaching')) {
    scores.service += 2
  }

  // Digital product indicators
  if (allText.includes('template') || allText.includes('course') || allText.includes('guide')) {
    scores.digital += 3
  }
  if (allText.includes('download') || allText.includes('ebook')) {
    scores.digital += 2
  }

  // Return highest scoring type
  return Object.entries(scores).reduce((a, b) => a[1] > b[1] ? a : b)[0]
}
```

## Confidence Calculation

Assign confidence levels based on data source completeness:

**High Confidence** (3+ data sources with complete data):

- ✓ Completion report found with all metrics
- ✓ README with description and features
- ✓ Strategy files with target audience and value prop
- ✓ All pricing inputs available

**Medium Confidence** (2-3 data sources, some gaps):

- ✓ Completion report with partial metrics
- ✓ README found but incomplete
- ✗ Strategy files missing (fallback to templates)
- ⚠ Pricing calculated from incomplete ROI data

**Low Confidence** (1 data source, major gaps):

- ⚠ Completion report missing or very incomplete
- ⚠ No README found
- ✗ No strategy files
- ✗ Pricing recommendations not possible

If confidence is LOW, warn user:

```text
⚠️ Low Confidence Extraction

Only found: README.md
Missing: Completion reports, strategy files, templates

Recommendation: This solution folder may not be complete.
  1. Check if this is a finished campaign/solution
  2. Look for completion reports in parent directories
  3. Manually provide missing data via /product:define

Proceed with limited data? [Yes/No]
```

## Error Handling

### Error 1: Folder Not Found

```text
❌ Error: Solution folder not found

Path: test-outputs/scenario-4-invalid/

Did you mean:
  • test-outputs/scenario-1-saas/ ✓
  • test-outputs/scenario-2-ecommerce/ ✓
  • test-outputs/scenario-3-b2b-services/ ✓

Usage: /product:extract-from-solution <folder-path>
```

### Error 2: No Extractable Data

```text
⚠️ Warning: No completion reports or README found

Folder: custom-solution/
Found files: 3 markdown files, 2 images

This folder doesn't appear to be an AI solution folder.

Expected structure:
  ✓ WEEK-*-COMPLETION-REPORT.md
  ✓ README.md or campaign/README.md
  ✓ strategy/*.md OR templates/*.md

Would you like to:
  1. Search parent directories for completion reports
  2. Specify a different folder
  3. Skip extraction and use /product:define directly

[Option 1] [Option 2] [Option 3]
```

### Error 3: Partial Data Extraction

```text
⚠️ Partial extraction completed

Found data:
  ✓ Product name: "AI Email Assistant"
  ✓ Description: Extracted from README
  ✗ Metrics: No completion report found
  ✗ Target audience: No strategy files found
  ⚠ Pricing: Calculated from generic assumptions

Confidence: Low (2/5 data sources)

Recommendation: Manually provide missing data in /product:define

Proceed with partial data? [Yes/No]
```
