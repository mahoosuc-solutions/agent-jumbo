## Sales Email (Cold Outreach)
Hi John,

I noticed your team at Acme scaled to 50+ people recently—congrats! But I'm guessing your calendar is now back-to-back meetings, and important action items are slipping through the cracks.

AI Meeting Assistant automatically captures, summarizes, and follows up on every meeting. No more "wait, what did we decide?" or forgotten tasks.

VP Engs like you are saving 10+ hours/week and closing deals 30% faster because nothing falls through the cracks.

Want a 10-minute demo? I can show you exactly how it works with your actual calendar.

Best,
[Your Name]
