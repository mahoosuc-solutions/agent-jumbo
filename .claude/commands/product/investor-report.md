- **Market sizing**: 3-5 minutes (TAM/SAM/SOM calculation)
- **Score calculation**: 2-3 minutes (weighted scoring algorithm)
- **Report generation**: 4-6 minutes (PDF + pitch deck creation)
- **Total**: 17-27 minutes vs. 40-60 hours manually
- **Batch mode**: ~5-7 minutes per product (parallel extraction + sequential analysis)
*(Includes: data extraction, competitive research, market analysis, financial modeling, pitch deck creation)*

## When to Use This Command

Use `/product/investor-report` when you need to:

1. **Validate Fundability**: Check if idea is investor-worthy before spending months building
2. **Investor Targeting**: Determine which investor types to approach (VC, angel, bootstrap)
3. **Competitive Intelligence**: Understand market landscape and positioning
4. **Pitch Preparation**: Get data-driven insights for investor conversations
5. **Progress Tracking**: Measure improvement in investment readiness over time
6. **Portfolio Review**: Evaluate multiple products for investment priority

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Full investor report for AI solution folder
/product/investor-report --folder ./ai-solutions/cloud-cost-optimizer

# Target specific investor type
/product/investor-report --folder ./ai-solutions/workflow-automation --target-investor-type vc

# Include auto-generated pitch deck
/product/investor-report --folder ./my-product --include-pitch-deck --export pdf

# Quick validation (no pitch deck)

```

## Workflow

### Input Requirements

${ARGUMENTS}

**Folder Structure** (AI solution folder):

```text
./ai-solutions/cloud-cost-optimizer/
├── product-info.md (REQUIRED - auto-generated if missing)
├── README.md (used for extraction)
├── solution.md (used for extraction)
├── pricing.md (used for extraction)
├── strategy/*.md (used for extraction)
├── WEEK-*-COMPLETION-REPORT.md (used for extraction)
└── package.json (used for tech stack extraction)
```

**NEW: Automatic Data Extraction**

If `product-info.md` doesn't exist, Step 0 will automatically extract product data from available files using the `/lib/extraction/` library. This provides intelligent data extraction with confidence scoring.

### Step 0: Product Data Extraction (2-4 min) **[NEW]**

**ONLY runs if `product-info.md` is missing or incomplete**

Uses the `/lib/extraction/` library to:

1. **Discover files** in the folder (README, completion reports, strategy files, etc.)
2. **Extract data** from multiple sources with priority waterfall:
   - Product name: completion reports (95%) > README H1 (85%) > package.json (70%) > folder name (60%)
   - Description: README paragraphs (85%) > completion report (85%) > solution.md (80%)
   - Problem: README problem section (85%) > solution.md (80%) > strategy files (75%)
   - Features: README features (85%) > solution.md (80%) > strategy files (75%)
   - Target Customer: strategy files (75%) > README (70%)
   - Pricing: pricing.md (80%) > README (75%)
   - Tech Stack: package.json (70%) > code analysis (60%)
   - Metrics: completion reports ONLY (95%) - never inferred
3. **Calculate confidence** using weighted scoring algorithm:
   - Overall confidence = weighted sum of field confidences
   - Threshold: ≥70% auto-proceed, 50-69% prompt for gaps, <50% block
4. **AI inference** for missing data (if enabled and confidence < 70%):
   - Infers description, problem, features, target customer (50% confidence)
   - Never infers: product name, metrics, exact pricing amounts
5. **Generate product-info.md** with confidence annotations:
   - High confidence sections (80%+): minimal review needed
   - Medium confidence (60-79%): verification recommended
   - Low confidence (<60%): likely needs revision
   - Missing data: marked with `<!-- CRITICAL -->` comments

**Extraction Process**:

```javascript
const { extractAndSave } = require('/lib/extraction');

const result = await extractAndSave(folderPath, {
  useAiInference: true,
  confidenceThreshold: 70,
  verbose: true
});

if (result.success && result.confidence.autoProceed) {
  // Proceed to investor analysis (Steps 1-8)
} else {
  // Show extraction report and prompt user to fill gaps
}
```

**Skip Extraction**: Use `--skip-extraction` flag if you have a manually created `product-info.md` and want to skip this step entirely.

**Batch Processing** **[NEW]**:

If `--batch` flag is provided with comma-separated folder paths, the system will:

1. Run Step 0 extraction for each folder in parallel
2. Generate product-info.md for each folder
3. Track overall progress (X/Y folders processed)
4. Continue with investor analysis for each folder sequentially
5. Generate portfolio summary report at the end

```javascript
const { batchExtract, generateBatchSummary } = require('/lib/extraction');

const folders = ['./folder1', './folder2', './folder3'];
const results = await batchExtract(folders, { useAiInference: true });

const summary = generateBatchSummary(results);
// summary.successful, summary.highConfidence, summary.averageConfidence
```

### Step 1: Parse Solution Folder (2 min)

- Read product-info.md (generated in Step 0 or pre-existing)
- Extract product name, description, target market
- Identify revenue model and pricing
- Capture any existing traction data
- List known competitors (if provided)

### Step 2: Market Opportunity Analysis (4 min)

- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): Global market size
- **SAM** (Serviceable Available Market): Realistic target segment
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): 3-year capture estimate
- Market growth rate & trends
- Regulatory/macro tailwinds or headwinds

### Step 3: Competitive Intelligence Gathering (6 min)

- Web search for direct competitors (same solution)
- Identify indirect competitors (alternative approaches)
- Analyze competitor funding rounds (Crunchbase, PitchBook data)
- Compare features, pricing, market share
- Identify white space opportunities

### Step 4: Differentiation Scoring (3 min)

Evaluate uniqueness on 5 dimensions:

1. **Technology Innovation** (0-20 points): Novel approach or commodity?
2. **Market Positioning** (0-20 points): Blue ocean or red ocean?
3. **Defensibility** (0-20 points): Moats (network effects, data, IP)
4. **Go-to-Market** (0-20 points): Unique distribution advantage?
5. **Timing** (0-20 points): Market ready or too early/late?

### Step 5: Traction Potential Assessment (2 min)

- Revenue indicators (if launched)
- User growth trajectory
- Market validation signals
- Partnership/pilot potential
- Viral coefficient estimate

### Step 6: Team/Execution Capability (2 min)

- Founder domain expertise
- Technical capability assessment
- Prior startup experience
- Network strength (advisors, partners)

### Step 7: Investment Worthiness Score Calculation (1 min)

Weighted scoring:

- **Market Opportunity**: 25 points
- **Competition & Differentiation**: 20 points
- **Traction Potential**: 20 points
- **Team/Execution**: 15 points
- **Business Model Viability**: 20 points

**Score Interpretation**:

- **90-100**: Exceptional - ready for top-tier VC
- **80-89**: Strong - ready for VC/angel fundraise
- **70-79**: Good - refine positioning, then fundraise
- **60-69**: Promising - build traction first (3-6 months)
- **50-59**: Weak - significant pivots needed
- **<50**: Not fundable - consider bootstrap or pivot

### Step 8: Generate Recommendations (3 min)

- **GO/NO-GO** decision for investor outreach
- **Recommended Investor Types**: VC (stage?), angel, strategic, or bootstrap
- **30-60-90 Day Action Plan** to increase score
