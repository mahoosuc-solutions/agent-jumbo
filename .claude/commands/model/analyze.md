# Model Analysis Command

## What This Command Does

Analyzes the complexity of a given task and recommends the optimal Claude model to use, balancing cost-effectiveness with performance requirements. Uses a 5-dimensional scoring system to evaluate tasks and route them to Haiku (fast/cheap), Sonnet (balanced), or Opus (powerful).

**Key Features:**

- Multi-dimensional complexity scoring (1-5 on each dimension)
- Cost-benefit analysis with pricing transparency
- Confidence ratings for recommendations
- Alternative model suggestions
- Estimated completion time by model

## Complexity Scoring Dimensions

Tasks are evaluated on 5 dimensions (1-5 each, total 5-25 points):

1. **Cognitive Load** (1-5)
   - 1: Single-step, straightforward task
   - 3: Multi-step with moderate complexity (3-8 steps)
   - 5: Highly complex, many interdependent steps (9+ steps)

2. **Domain Expertise** (1-5)
   - 1: General knowledge, no specialized skills
   - 3: Moderate domain knowledge (API integration, standard frameworks)
   - 5: Deep expertise required (security audits, advanced algorithms, compliance)

3. **Reasoning Depth** (1-5)
   - 1: Direct/literal execution
   - 3: Some decision-making and logic
   - 5: Complex reasoning, novel problem-solving, architecture design

4. **Risk & Impact** (1-5)
   - 1: Low risk, easily reversible
   - 3: Moderate risk, affects non-critical systems
   - 5: High risk, production systems, security, compliance

5. **Ambiguity** (1-5)
   - 1: Crystal clear requirements
   - 3: Some interpretation needed
   - 5: Highly ambiguous, requires clarification and exploration

## Model Routing Rules

**Total Score → Model Selection:**

- **5-10 points**: Claude Haiku (simple/straightforward)
- **11-17 points**: Claude Sonnet (medium complexity) ⭐ Most tasks
- **18-25 points**: Claude Opus (high complexity)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple File Edit

```bash
/model:analyze "Fix typo in README.md line 42, change 'teh' to 'the'"
```

```

## Error Handling

**Ambiguous Tasks:**

```text
⚠️ Task ambiguity detected (score: 5/5)
Recommended action: Request clarification before selecting model

Questions to resolve:
1. What specific aspects of the system should be refactored?
2. Are there performance/security requirements?
3. What is the acceptable risk level?

Tentative recommendation: Start with Sonnet, escalate to Opus if needed
```

**Budget Conflicts:**

```text
⚠️ Budget constraint conflict
Recommended model: Opus ($0.001)
Budget allows: Sonnet ($0.0003)

Risk: Using Sonnet may result in incomplete security analysis
Recommendation: Either increase budget or reduce scope

Alternative: Break task into phases
- Phase 1: Sonnet for initial review → $0.0003
- Phase 2: Opus for critical findings → $0.001 (only if issues found)
```
