💰 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
=========================

Task Category → Recommended Model:

1. Simple Edits/Formatting → Haiku (10x cheaper, equal quality)
2. Documentation → Haiku (3x cheaper, nearly equal quality)
3. Code Generation → Sonnet (3x cheaper than Opus, 90% quality)
4. Code Review → Sonnet (good depth, reasonable cost)
5. Refactoring → Sonnet (best balance)
6. Testing → Sonnet (comprehensive test generation)
7. Security Auditing → Opus (REQUIRED, no substitute)
8. Architecture Design → Opus (long-term impact justifies cost)

Optimal Model Mix (estimated for typical project):
- 30% Haiku (docs, simple tasks) → $3/month
- 60% Sonnet (development) → $18/month
- 10% Opus (security, architecture) → $10/month
Total: $31/month for 1,000 tasks

vs. All-Sonnet Approach:
- 100% Sonnet → $300/month for 1,000 tasks
Savings: $269/month (89.7% reduction)

vs. All-Opus Approach:
- 100% Opus → $1,000/month for 1,000 tasks
Savings: $969/month (96.9% reduction)

🎯 KEY INSIGHTS
===============

1. Haiku Surprises
   - Documentation: 8.8/10 quality at 1/3 cost
   - Simple code: 7.2/10 quality, often sufficient
   - Speed: 3-5x faster than Sonnet
   Verdict: Massively underutilized in most projects

2. Sonnet Sweet Spot
   - Best all-around model for development
   - 98.2% success rate (highest)
   - Quality/cost ratio optimal for most tasks
   Verdict: Should be default choice

3. Opus Precision
   - Security audits: 9.7/10 (60% better than Sonnet)
   - Complex algorithms: 9.4/10 (15% better than Sonnet)
   - Speed: 2x slower than Sonnet
   Verdict: Reserved for critical high-impact tasks

4. The 30-60-10 Rule
   - 30% Haiku (simple/documentation)
   - 60% Sonnet (development/default)
   - 10% Opus (critical/complex)
   Result: 90% cost savings vs all-Opus, minimal quality loss

📋 RECOMMENDATIONS
==================

Immediate Actions:
1. Switch documentation tasks to Haiku → Save $45/month
2. Keep development on Sonnet → Maintain quality
3. Upgrade security audits to Opus → Prevent incidents

Long-Term Strategy:
1. Default to Sonnet, prove need for Opus
2. Aggressively move simple tasks to Haiku
3. Never compromise on security (always Opus)
4. Monitor success rates to validate model choices

Configuration Changes:
1. Update .claude/config/routing-rules.yaml:
   - documentation: haiku
   - development: sonnet
   - security: opus
2. Set budget alerts for Opus usage
3. Track Haiku success rate on expanded tasks
```

🔒 SECURITY BENCHMARK RESULTS
==============================

Average Quality Scores:
- Haiku:  6.1/10 ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT for production
- Sonnet: 8.2/10 ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE for non-critical only
- Opus:   9.7/10 ✓ REQUIRED for production security

Critical Issues Detected:

- Opus:   $0.0010 (3% false negative rate) ✓

⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING
====================

Using Haiku or Sonnet for security audits creates FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.

Real-World Impact:
- Missed vulnerability → Production breach
- Average data breach cost: $4.45M (IBM 2023)
- Opus cost: $0.001 per audit
- ROI: Prevents $4.45M loss for $0.001 → 4,450,000,000% ROI

RECOMMENDATION: ALWAYS USE OPUS FOR SECURITY TASKS

Human Validation Results:
✓ 3 security experts reviewed Opus findings
✓ 97% agreement on critical issues
✓ 94% agreement on medium issues
✓ Expert consensus: "Opus-level depth required for production"

      "id": "hipaa-1",
      "category": "compliance-check",
      "description": "Review patient data handling for HIPAA compliance",
      "input": "path/to/code/patient-records.py",
      "expected_features": [
        "encryption at rest",
        "audit logging",

  ]
}
```

## Integration with Other Commands

```bash
# Benchmark before optimization
/model:benchmark --export json --output baseline.json

# Run optimization
/model:optimize

# Benchmark after optimization
/model:benchmark --export json --output optimized.json

# Compare results
/model:benchmark --compare baseline.json optimized.json

# Generate report
/model:report --benchmark-analysis baseline.json optimized.json
```

## Error Handling

**Benchmark Failures:**

```text
⚠️ Benchmark Failure

Task: Security Audit
Model: Opus
Error: Timeout after 60s

Possible causes:
1. Task too complex for time limit
2. API performance issue
3. Task definition error

Actions taken:
- Retried with 120s timeout: SUCCESS
- Logged for investigation
- Continued with remaining tests

Recommendation: Review task complexity or increase timeout
```

**Quality Validation Disagreement:**

```text
⚠️ Human Validation Conflict

Task: Code Review
Model: Sonnet
AI Quality Score: 9.1/10
Human Validator Score: 7.5/10
Disagreement: 1.6 points (18%)

Validator feedback:
"Missed subtle edge case in error handling"

Action: Incorporating feedback into quality scoring model
Status: Learning from human expert input
```

## Best Practices

1. **Benchmark regularly**: Run benchmarks monthly or after major changes
2. **Use representative tasks**: Benchmark tasks should match real workloads
3. **Include human validation**: Especially for quality-critical categories
4. **Track trends**: Monitor performance changes over time
5. **Act on findings**: Use benchmark results to guide optimization
6. **Document exceptions**: Note when you override benchmark recommendations
7. **Share results**: Make benchmark findings accessible to team
