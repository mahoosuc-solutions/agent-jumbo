# Model Optimization Command

## What This Command Does

Analyzes your current AI agent ecosystem and optimizes model selection across all agents, slash commands, and workflows to maximize cost savings while maintaining quality. Reviews historical usage patterns, identifies over-engineering, and provides actionable recommendations.

**Key Features:**

- Analyzes all agents in `.claude/agents/` and commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Reviews historical task patterns and outcomes
- Identifies cost optimization opportunities
- Suggests model reassignments with impact analysis
- Generates optimization plan with ROI projections
- Optional auto-apply mode for immediate optimization

## Core Optimization Strategies

### 1. Agent-Level Optimization

Review each agent's default model selection and recommend adjustments based on actual task complexity.

### 2. Command-Level Optimization

Analyze slash command usage patterns and optimize model routing per command.

### 3. Workflow-Level Optimization

Optimize multi-agent workflows to use the right model at each stage.

### 4. Pattern-Based Optimization

Identify recurring task patterns and create optimized routing rules.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Optimization Scan

```bash
/model:optimize
```

## Business Value / ROI

### Cost Optimization

- **Typical savings: 30-50%** across all model usage
- **No quality loss**: Maintains or improves task success rates
- **Automatic enforcement**: Once configured, optimization is continuous

### Quality Improvements

- **Better model matching**: Use Opus when it matters, Haiku when it doesn't
- **Risk reduction**: Automatically upgrade security/compliance tasks to Opus
- **Faster simple tasks**: Haiku responds in <1 second vs Sonnet's 1-3 seconds

### Real-World ROI Examples

**Small Team (500 tasks/month)**

- Current spend: $75/month (all Sonnet)
- Optimized: $42/month (40% Haiku, 50% Sonnet, 10% Opus)
- **Monthly savings: $33 → Annual savings: $396**

**Medium Team (2,000 tasks/month)**

- Current spend: $300/month (mixed, unoptimized)
- Optimized: $168/month (systematic optimization)
- **Monthly savings: $132 → Annual savings: $1,584**

**Enterprise (10,000 tasks/month)**

- Current spend: $1,500/month
- Optimized: $825/month
- **Monthly savings: $675 → Annual savings: $8,100**

## Success Metrics

### Cost Metrics

- **Cost Per Task**: Average spend per AI task
  - **Target: <$0.0002** (indicates good Haiku usage)
- **Monthly Spend**: Total AI model costs
  - **Target: 30-50% reduction after optimization**

### Quality Metrics

- **Task Success Rate**: % of tasks completed successfully first try
  - **Target: 95%+** (optimization shouldn't hurt quality)
- **Escalation Rate**: % of tasks that need model upgrade
  - **Target: <5%** (indicates good initial routing)

### Efficiency Metrics

- **Average Response Time**: Speed of task completion
  - **Target: Improve 10-20%** (more Haiku = faster responses)
- **Over-Engineering Rate**: % of tasks using unnecessarily powerful models
  - **Target: <10%** (was typically 30-40% before optimization)

### Business Metrics

- **ROI**: Savings vs. optimization time investment
  - **Target: 10x return** (1 hour optimization saves 10+ hours of waste)
- **Quality Incidents**: Production issues due to model selection
  - **Target: 0** (security tasks should auto-upgrade to Opus)

## Advanced Options

### Flags

- `--auto-apply`: Apply optimizations without confirmation
- `--backup`: Create backup before applying changes (recommended)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would change without applying
- `--agent <name>`: Optimize specific agent only
- `--workflow <name>`: Optimize specific workflow only
- `--timeframe <days>`: Analyze usage over N days (default: 30)
- `--threshold <percentage>`: Minimum savings threshold to recommend (default: 10%)
- `--aggressive`: More aggressive optimization (higher risk)
- `--conservative`: Conservative optimization (lower risk)
- `--rollback <timestamp>`: Revert to previous configuration

### Configuration Files

**Optimization Rules** (`.claude/config/optimization-rules.yaml`):

```yaml
rules:
  # Never downgrade security tasks
  - pattern: "security|audit|compliance|HIPAA|PCI-DSS|SOC2"
    minimum_model: opus
    override: never

  # Always downgrade documentation
  - pattern: "documentation|readme|comment|typo"
    maximum_model: haiku
    exceptions:
      - "API documentation"
      - "architecture documentation"

  # Workflow-specific rules
  - workflow: "/dev:full-cycle"
    steps:
      architecture: opus
      boilerplate: haiku
      security: opus
```

**Budget Constraints** (`.claude/config/budget.yaml`):

```yaml
budget:
  monthly_limit: 200.00
  alert_threshold: 0.80  # Alert at 80% of budget

  model_quotas:
    opus:
      max_monthly_spend: 60.00
      max_tasks: 1000
      require_approval_above: 100  # tasks/month

    sonnet:
      max_monthly_spend: 120.00
      preferred: true

    haiku:
      max_monthly_spend: 20.00
      unlimited: true  # No quota enforcement
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Conservative Strategy (Default)

- Only optimize tasks with 95%+ confidence
- Preserve all existing upgrades (Opus stays Opus)
- Minimal risk to quality
- Typical savings: 30-35%

### Balanced Strategy

- Optimize tasks with 85%+ confidence
- Smart downgrades with fallback mechanisms
- Some calculated risk for higher savings
- Typical savings: 40-45%

### Aggressive Strategy

- Optimize tasks with 70%+ confidence
- Aggressive downgrades with auto-escalation
- Higher risk, but monitors for failures
- Typical savings: 50-60%
- **Use with caution**: Monitor closely for quality issues

## Integration with Other Commands

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze current state
/model:report --detailed

# Step 2: Run optimization
/model:optimize --dry-run

# Step 3: Review and apply
/model:optimize --auto-apply --backup

# Step 4: Monitor results
/model:report --compare-before-after

# Step 5: Fine-tune
/model:optimize --agent specific-agent --aggressive
```

## Rollback and Safety

### Automatic Backups

Every optimization creates a timestamped backup:

```text
.claude/backups/optimization-2025-11-25-14-30-00/
├── agents/
├── commands/
├── config/
└── manifest.json
```

### Rollback

```bash
# List available backups
/model:optimize --list-backups

# Rollback to specific backup
/model:optimize --rollback 2025-11-25-14-30-00

# Rollback last optimization
/model:optimize --rollback last
```

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes before applying
2. **Automatic backups**: Every change is reversible
3. **Confidence thresholds**: Only optimize high-confidence changes
4. **Never downgrade security**: Critical tasks stay on Opus
5. **Monitoring**: Track success rates after optimization
6. **Auto-escalation**: Failed tasks automatically retry with better model

## Error Handling

**Insufficient Data:**

```text
⚠️ Insufficient usage data for optimization
Current data: 47 tasks over 7 days
Recommended: 200+ tasks over 30 days

Suggestions:
1. Wait for more usage data (recommended)
2. Run optimization with --conservative flag
3. Use /model:analyze for individual task optimization
```

**Conflicting Requirements:**

```text
⚠️ Optimization conflict detected

Agent: security-audit-agent
Current: Opus
Recommendation: Sonnet (cost optimization)
Conflict: Security policy requires Opus minimum

Resolution: Keeping Opus (policy override)
This agent excluded from optimization.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run monthly**: Optimize at least once per month as patterns change
2. **Start conservative**: Use default strategy first, then try balanced
3. **Monitor quality**: Track success rates after optimization
4. **Use backups**: Always create backups before auto-apply
5. **Review suggestions**: Don't blindly accept all recommendations
6. **Set budgets**: Configure budget constraints to prevent overspending
7. **Document exceptions**: Add comments for manual overrides
