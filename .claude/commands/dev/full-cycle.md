# Full-Cycle Development

Feature: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Step 1: Validate Input & Parse Options

```bash
ARGS="$ARGUMENTS"
FEATURE_DESCRIPTION=$(echo "$ARGS" | sed 's/--skip-review\|--auto-deploy//g' | xargs)
SKIP_REVIEW=$(echo "$ARGS" | grep -q '\-\-skip-review' && echo "true" || echo "false")
AUTO_DEPLOY=$(echo "$ARGS" | grep -q '\-\-auto-deploy' && echo "true" || echo "false")

if [ ${#FEATURE_DESCRIPTION} -lt 10 ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Feature description too short (minimum 10 characters)"
  exit 1
fi

TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

echo "✓ Full-cycle workflow initialized"
echo "  Feature: $FEATURE_DESCRIPTION"
echo "  Skip review: $SKIP_REVIEW"
echo "  Auto-deploy: $AUTO_DEPLOY"
echo "  Timestamp: $TIMESTAMP"
```

## Step 2: Execute Full Development Cycle

```javascript
const FEATURE_DESCRIPTION = process.env.FEATURE_DESCRIPTION;
const SKIP_REVIEW = process.env.SKIP_REVIEW === 'true';
const AUTO_DEPLOY = process.env.AUTO_DEPLOY === 'true';
const TIMESTAMP = process.env.TIMESTAMP;

await Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Execute complete development cycle',
  prompt: `Execute full development workflow for: ${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}

Options:
- Skip review: ${SKIP_REVIEW}
- Auto-deploy: ${AUTO_DEPLOY}

COMPLETE WORKFLOW (7 Phases):

**PHASE 1: Planning (5-15 min)**
Execute: /dev/feature-request "${FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}"
Output: Feature specification created
Checkpoint: Review spec with user, get approval to proceed

**PHASE 2: Setup (1-2 min)**
Execute: /dev/create-branch [feature-slug]
Output: Feature branch created from main

**PHASE 3: Implementation (30-120 min)**
Execute: /dev/implement [feature-name]
Process:
- AI implements feature per specification
- Routes to specialized agents as needed
- Adds tests inline
- Commits progressively
- Generates implementation report
Output: Feature implemented with tests

**PHASE 4: Testing (15-30 min)**
Execute: /dev/test
Process:
- Run full test suite
- If failures: AI analyzes and suggests fixes
- Apply fixes and re-test until passing
Requirement: All tests must pass to proceed

**PHASE 5: Review ${SKIP_REVIEW ? '(SKIPPED)' : '(15-30 min)'}**
${SKIP_REVIEW ? 'Skipped per --skip-review flag' :
`Execute: /dev/review
Process:
- Automated checks (linting, types, security, secrets)
- AI code review (7 categories)
- Issues categorized by severity
- Show critical issues to user
Checkpoint: If critical issues, ask to fix or proceed with warnings`}

**PHASE 6: PR & Merge (5-10 min)**
Execute: /dev/create-pr
Output: PR created with AI-generated description

Checkpoint: Show PR summary, request approval to merge
- Files changed, test coverage, quality scores
- User approves or cancels

If approved:
  Execute: /dev/merge
  Output: PR merged to main

**PHASE 7: Deployment ${AUTO_DEPLOY ? '(AUTOMATIC)' : '(5-10 min)'}**
${AUTO_DEPLOY ? 'Auto-deploy per --auto-deploy flag' :
`Checkpoint: Ask user "Deploy to production now?"
- Yes → Proceed with deployment
- No → Stop (deploy manually later)
- Staging first → Deploy to staging, ask again`}

If deployment approved:
  Execute: /devops/deploy production
  Process:
  - Pre-deployment backup (if DB changes)
  - Deploy with health checks
  - Post-deployment verification
  - Monitor for issues

  If verification fails:
    Ask: "Rollback or debug?"
    If rollback: /devops/rollback

**OUTPUT: Generate Complete Summary**

Save to: .claude/full-cycle-summary-${TIMESTAMP}.md

}

**CHECKPOINT MANAGEMENT**:
The workflow includes 3-4 human checkpoints:
1. After planning: Review and approve feature spec
2. ${!SKIP_REVIEW ? 'After review: Review issues, decide to fix or proceed' : ''}
3. Before merge: Approve PR
4. ${!AUTO_DEPLOY ? 'Before deployment: Approve deployment' : ''}

These ensure human oversight at critical decision points while automating the heavy lifting.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- All phases complete successfully
- All tests passing
- ${!SKIP_REVIEW ? 'Code review passed (or approved with warnings)' : 'Basic checks passed'}
- Deployed and verified
- Total time < 3 hours for typical feature
- Time saved: 60-70% vs manual workflow`,

  context: {
    feature_description: FEATURE_DESCRIPTION,
    skip_review: SKIP_REVIEW,
    auto_deploy: AUTO_DEPLOY,
    timestamp: TIMESTAMP,
    summary_output: `.claude/full-cycle-summary-${TIMESTAMP}.md`
  }
});
```

## Step 3: Validate Output

```bash
TIMESTAMP="$TIMESTAMP"
SUMMARY_FILE=".claude/full-cycle-summary-${TIMESTAMP}.md"

# Check summary created
if [ ! -f "$SUMMARY_FILE" ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Full-cycle summary not created"
  exit 1
fi

# Check minimum size
FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$SUMMARY_FILE")
if [ $FILE_SIZE -lt 500 ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Summary too small (< 500 bytes)"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ Full-cycle validation complete"
echo "  Summary: $SUMMARY_FILE ($FILE_SIZE bytes)"
```

## Guidelines

- **Use for Standard Features**: Well-defined features (<1 day work)
- **Trust AI**: Best with --skip-review for faster iteration
- **Monitor Deployment**: Always monitor after production deploy
- **Checkpoints Matter**: Human oversight at critical decision points
- **Time Savings**: 60-70% faster than manual 7-command workflow
