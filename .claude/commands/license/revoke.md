## REVOCATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: License Verification

```sql
SELECT l.*,
       o.name as organization_name,
       o.id as organization_id,
       c.email as contact_email,
       c.name as contact_name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM license_activations
        WHERE license_id = l.id AND status = 'active') as active_activations,
       (SELECT array_agg(machine_id_hash) FROM license_activations
        WHERE license_id = l.id AND status = 'active') as active_machines
FROM licenses l
JOIN organizations o ON l.organization_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN contacts c ON o.primary_contact_id = c.id
WHERE l.id = '${license_id}';
```

### Phase 3: Elevated Approval (Critical/High Severity)

For `piracy`, `fraud`, `security`, `abuse`, or `legal` reasons:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

```text
ELEVATED APPROVAL REQUIRED

This revocation will immediately terminate access for 45 active users.

Reason: Piracy - License key publicly shared
Evidence: Key found on warez-forum.example

Options:
1. APPROVE - Revoke license immediately
2. APPROVE WITH REPLACEMENT - Revoke and issue new key to legitimate customer
3. DENY - Cancel revocation (investigate further)
4. ESCALATE - Escalate to security team
```

### Phase 4: Execute Revocation

#### 4.1 Revoke License Record

```sql
UPDATE licenses
SET status = 'revoked',
    revoked_at = NOW(),
    revocation_reason = '${reason}',
    revoked_by = '${operator_id}',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '${license_id}';
```

#### 4.2 Deactivate All Activations

```sql
UPDATE license_activations
SET status = 'revoked',
    revoked_at = NOW()
WHERE license_id = '${license_id}'
  AND status = 'active';
```

#### 4.3 Invalidate Offline Tokens

```sql
UPDATE license_offline_tokens
SET status = 'revoked'
WHERE license_id = '${license_id}'
  AND status = 'active';
```

#### 4.4 Add to Blacklist (Piracy/Fraud)

```sql
-- Blacklist the key hash to prevent re-use
INSERT INTO license_blacklist (
  license_key_hash, reason, added_at
) VALUES (
  '${license_key_hash}', '${reason}', NOW()
);

-- Blacklist machine IDs that activated the pirated key
INSERT INTO machine_blacklist (machine_id_hash, license_id, reason, added_at)
SELECT machine_id_hash, '${license_id}', 'piracy_association', NOW()
FROM license_activations
WHERE license_id = '${license_id}'
  AND status = 'revoked'
  -- Only blacklist activations from suspicious patterns
  AND (
    created_at > '${compromise_date}'  -- Activated after leak
    OR ip_country IN ('RU', 'CN', 'IN')  -- High-risk regions
    OR activation_count > 10  -- Unusual activation frequency
  );
```

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Audit Log

```sql
INSERT INTO license_audit_logs (
  license_id, action, actor_type, actor_id,
  ip_address, details
) VALUES (
  '${license_id}', 'revoked', 'operator', '${operator_id}',
  '${operator_ip}',
  '{
    "reason": "${reason}",
    "severity": "${severity}",
    "activations_terminated": ${activation_count},
    "offline_tokens_invalidated": ${token_count},
    "evidence": "${evidence_summary}",
    "approval_reference": "${approval_id}",
    "replacement_issued": ${replacement_issued}
  }'
);
```

### Phase 6: Customer Notification (If Applicable)

#### Piracy/Fraud (No Advance Notice)

```text
Subject: Important Security Notice - License Suspended

Dear John,

We have detected that your license key (lic_abc123) has been
compromised and is being used by unauthorized parties.

To protect your account and our platform, we have revoked this
license immediately.

WHAT HAPPENED:
Your license key was found publicly shared on an unauthorized
website, enabling hundreds of unauthorized installations.

NEXT STEPS:
1. We have issued a replacement license to your email
2. Re-activate your installations with the new key
3. Review your security practices for key storage

If you believe this action was taken in error, please contact
our security team immediately at security@example.com.

[Contact Security Team]

Best regards,
Security Team
```

#### Customer Request (Confirmation)

```text
Subject: License Cancellation Confirmed

Dear John,

As requested, your license (lic_abc123) has been cancelled.

CANCELLATION DETAILS:
• License: Enterprise Perpetual
• Effective: March 15, 2025 (end of current period)
• Refund: $4,000 pro-rated (60% of year remaining)

Your refund will be processed within 5-7 business days.

If you change your mind, you can reactivate within 30 days
by contacting support@example.com.

Thank you for being a customer.

Best regards,
Customer Success Team
```

### Phase 7: Issue Replacement (If Legitimate Customer)

If the license was compromised but the customer is legitimate:

```bash
# Generate replacement license
/license/generate ${deal_id} \
  --type ${original_type} \
  --tier ${original_tier} \
  --seats ${original_seats} \
  --replacement-for ${revoked_license_id}
```

```sql
-- Link replacement to original
UPDATE licenses
SET replaced_by = '${new_license_id}'
WHERE id = '${revoked_license_id}';

UPDATE licenses
SET replaces = '${revoked_license_id}',
    notes = 'Replacement for revoked license due to ${reason}'
WHERE id = '${new_license_id}';
```

### Phase 8: Update Zoho CRM

- Set Account `License_Status` = "Revoked"
- Set Account `Revocation_Reason` = "${reason}"
- Set Account `Revocation_Date` = NOW()
- Log activity: "License revoked: ${reason}"
- If replacement: Log "Replacement license issued: ${new_license_id}"
- Create task for account manager follow-up (if legitimate customer)
