# /life:wellness - Health & Productivity Dashboard

Track fitness, nutrition, sleep, and mental health while measuring correlation with energy, productivity, and goal progress.

## Quick Start

**Log today's wellness metrics:**

```bash
/life:wellness track
```

**Analyze health correlations:**

```bash
/life:wellness analyze
```

**Connect health to life goals:**

```bash
/life:wellness goals
```

**Integrate wearable data:**

```bash
/life:wellness integrate
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **health optimization where wellness metrics directly drive productivity and goal achievement**.

**Key Principle**: Your health is not separate from your goals. Sleep quality, exercise, nutrition, and mental health directly impact:

- Energy levels (ability to do deep work)
- Decision quality (cognitive function)
- Stress resilience (ability to handle pressure)
- Goal progress (compound effect of better habits)

The system tracks 4 health domains and measures correlation with productivity and goal progress.

## Mode 2: ANALYZE - Find Health Correlations

Measure how wellness metrics correlate with productivity and energy.

### Key Correlations to Track

**Sleep vs. Productivity**

- Hypothesis: More sleep → higher productivity and energy
- Track: Sleep hours vs. Daily productivity rating (1-10)
- Example:

  ```yaml
  Monday: 7 hours sleep → Productivity: 7/10
  Tuesday: 6 hours sleep → Productivity: 5/10
  Wednesday: 8 hours sleep → Productivity: 9/10

  CORRELATION: Strong positive (more sleep = higher productivity)
  ```

**Exercise vs. Energy**

- Hypothesis: Regular exercise → higher energy throughout day
- Track: Exercise hours/week vs. Average daily energy (1-10)
- Example:

  ```text
  Week 1: 3 hours exercise → Average energy: 5.5/10
  Week 2: 5 hours exercise → Average energy: 7/10
  Week 3: 7 hours exercise → Average energy: 8/10

  CORRELATION: Strong positive (more exercise = higher energy)
  ```

**Nutrition vs. Mental Clarity**

- Hypothesis: Better nutrition → higher mental clarity
- Track: Daily nutrition quality (1-10) vs. Mental clarity (1-10)
- Example:

  ```yaml
  Monday: Nutrition 7/10 → Mental clarity: 6/10
  Tuesday: Nutrition 9/10 → Mental clarity: 8/10
  Wednesday: Nutrition 5/10 → Mental clarity: 4/10

  CORRELATION: Strong positive (better nutrition = better clarity)
  ```

**Stress vs. Sleep Quality**

- Hypothesis: Lower stress → better sleep
- Track: Daily stress level vs. Night sleep quality
- Example:

  ```yaml
  Monday: Stress 7/10 → Sleep quality: 5/10
  Tuesday: Stress 3/10 → Sleep quality: 9/10
  Wednesday: Stress 5/10 → Sleep quality: 7/10

  CORRELATION: Strong negative (lower stress = better sleep)
  ```

**Meditation vs. Stress**

- Hypothesis: Regular meditation → lower daily stress
- Track: Meditation minutes/day vs. Stress rating
- Example:

  ```yaml
  Monday: 0 min meditation → Stress: 8/10
  Tuesday: 10 min meditation → Stress: 5/10
  Wednesday: 20 min meditation → Stress: 3/10
  Thursday: 0 min meditation → Stress: 7/10

  CORRELATION: Strong negative (more meditation = lower stress)
  ```

### Correlation Analysis Report

After 4 weeks of tracking, analyze:

**Strongest Positive Correlations**:
What wellness actions most strongly increase energy, productivity, and mood?

- Example: "Sleep quality has strongest impact on productivity (+0.87 correlation)"
- Example: "Exercise strongly increases energy levels (+0.82 correlation)"

**Strongest Negative Correlations**:
What factors most strongly decrease performance?

- Example: "Stress strongly decreases sleep quality (-0.74 correlation)"
- Example: "Alcohol reduces next-day energy (-0.65 correlation)"

**Weak/No Correlation**:
What wellness actions don't actually help (surprising findings)?

- Example: "Caffeine intake shows no correlation with productivity"
- Example: "Supplements show minimal benefit"

**Actionable Insights**:

1. Double down on high-impact actions
   - "Sleep is top priority - protect 8 hours/night"
   - "Exercise is energy multiplier - prioritize 5+ hours/week"

2. Eliminate low-impact actions
   - "Meditation not helping stress - try different approach"
   - "Journaling not showing benefit - replace with walks"

3. Test new interventions
   - "Try morning cold shower for energy boost"
   - "Test outdoor exercise vs. gym for mood"

### Goal Progress Correlation

Track how wellness impacts life goal progress:

**Financial Independence Goal**:

- Hypothesis: Better health → Higher productivity → More revenue
- Track: Monthly wellness score vs. Monthly revenue/progress
- Example:

  ```text
  Month 1: Wellness score 6/10 → Revenue: $8K → Goal progress: 60%
  Month 2: Wellness score 8/10 → Revenue: $12K → Goal progress: 85%
  Month 3: Wellness score 9/10 → Revenue: $15K → Goal progress: 95%

  INSIGHT: Each point increase in wellness = +$2.3K/month revenue
  ```

**Career/Professional Goal**:

- Hypothesis: Better sleep/exercise → Higher quality work
- Track: Sleep hours vs. Work quality rating
- Example:

  ```text
  Week with 6 hrs/night sleep → Work quality: 6/10 → Client satisfaction: 70%
  Week with 7.5 hrs/night sleep → Work quality: 8/10 → Client satisfaction: 85%

  INSIGHT: Additional 1.5 hrs sleep = +20% work quality
  ```

### Wellness Scorecard

Track overall wellness on a 0-10 scale:

**Components** (each 0-10):

1. Sleep quality (avg 1-10 rating)
2. Exercise consistency (% of planned workouts)
3. Nutrition quality (1-10 scale)
4. Mental clarity (avg 1-10 rating)
5. Stress level (inverse: 10 - stress rating)

**Overall Wellness Score** = Average of 5 components

**Target**: 8/10 or higher for optimal goal achievement

**Example this month**:

```text
Sleep quality: 8/10
Exercise consistency: 85% → 8.5/10
Nutrition quality: 7/10

---

## Wellness Scorecard Integration

Connect wellness metrics to goal alignment score.

### Wellness Impact on Goal Alignment

Each goal gets a **Wellness Multiplier**:

```text
Base Goal Alignment Score: 75/100
├── Sleep Quality Bonus: +5 (if 7.5+ hours last night)
├── Exercise Consistency Bonus: +3 (if on track this week)
├── Nutrition Quality Bonus: +2 (if good meals today)
├── Stress/Mental Health Bonus: +5 (if stress <5)
└── Final Alignment Score: 90/100 (with wellness factors)
```

**Example**:

```text
BUSINESS GOAL: Build $200K/year software business
├── Base alignment: 75/100
├── Sleep: 7.5h (full +5 bonus) = 80/100
├── Exercise: 4/5 days (+3 bonus) = 83/100
├── Nutrition: 7/10 (+2 bonus) = 85/100
├── Stress: 3/10 (+5 bonus) = 90/100
└── FINAL ALIGNMENT: 90/100 (Exceptional)
    → You're in peak condition for this goal this week
```

If wellness scores are low:

```text
FINANCIAL GOAL: Same goal, poor wellness day
├── Base alignment: 75/100
├── Sleep: 5.5h (no bonus, -2 penalty) = 73/100
├── Exercise: 0/5 days (no bonus) = 73/100
├── Nutrition: 4/10 (-2 penalty) = 71/100
├── Stress: 8/10 (no bonus, -3 penalty) = 68/100
└── FINAL ALIGNMENT: 68/100 (Weak alignment)
    → Not a good day for this goal - low energy expected
    → Recommendation: Rest, recover, delay decision-making
```

---
