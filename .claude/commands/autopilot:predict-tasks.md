# Autopilot Predict Tasks Command

## Overview

**ULTIMATE PRODUCTIVITY FEATURE**: AI analyzes your patterns and proactively predicts upcoming tasks before you think of them.

**Part of Phase 3**: AI Autopilot features

## What This Command Does

- ✅ Analyzes historical patterns (emails, calendar, tasks)
- ✅ Predicts upcoming needs (lease renewals, reports, deadlines)
- ✅ Creates tasks automatically with AI-estimated deadlines
- ✅ Schedules via Motion AI for optimal completion
- ✅ Learns from your corrections and feedback
- ✅ **Saves 2-3 hours/week** in planning

## Usage

```bash
# Predict this week's tasks
/autopilot:predict-tasks

# Predict next month
/autopilot:predict-tasks --period month

# Only high-confidence predictions
/autopilot:predict-tasks --confidence 80

# Preview without creating
/autopilot:predict-tasks --dry-run
```

## AI Prediction Engine

```javascript
// Analyze patterns
const predictions = await claude.predictTasks({
  prompt: `Analyze these data sources and predict upcoming tasks:

  CALENDAR PATTERNS:
  - Monthly team meetings (last Friday of month)
  - Quarterly board meetings (every 3 months)
  - Client check-ins (every 2 weeks)

  EMAIL PATTERNS:
  - Invoice reminders (1st of month)
  - Report requests (deadline: 5th of month)
  - Lease renewals (90 days before expiry)

  TASK HISTORY:
  - Monthly financial reconciliation (completed last 12 months)
  - Quarterly tax estimates (completed last 4 quarters)
  - Weekly property inspections (every Thursday)

  CURRENT DATE: ${new Date().toISOString()}
  PREDICT FOR: Next ${period}

  For each prediction, provide:
  {
    "task": "Clear task description",
    "reasoning": "Why this is predicted",
    "deadline": "Estimated deadline",
    "confidence": 0-100,
    "recurrence": "one-time|weekly|monthly|quarterly",
    "priority": "low|medium|high",
    "estimatedDuration": "2 hours"
  }
  `
});
```

## Pattern Learning

The AI learns from:

1. **Calendar events**: Recurring patterns, meeting frequencies
2. **Email analysis**: Recurring requests, deadline patterns
3. **Completed tasks**: Historical completion dates
4. **Business cycles**: Monthly/quarterly/annual rhythms
5. **Context patterns**: Property-specific, client-specific cycles

### Examples of Learned Patterns

```text
Lease Renewals:
  Pattern: 90 days before lease expiry
  Confidence: 98%
  Source: 12 past renewals, all sent 90 days prior

Monthly Reports:
  Pattern: 5th of each month
  Confidence: 95%
  Source: Completed last 18 months on 5th

Client Check-ins:
  Pattern: Every 2 weeks, Tuesdays 2 PM
  Confidence: 92%
  Source: Calendar history shows bi-weekly pattern

Property Inspections:
  Pattern: Weekly, Thursdays 10 AM
  Confidence: 90%
  Source: Task completion history
```
