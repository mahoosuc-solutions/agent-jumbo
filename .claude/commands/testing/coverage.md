Analyze test coverage for: **${ARGUMENTS:-entire project}**

## What This Command Does

This command analyzes your test coverage, identifies gaps in testing, and automatically generates tests for uncovered code. It provides detailed insights into which lines, branches, functions, and files lack test coverage, then uses AI to create comprehensive tests that improve coverage while maintaining quality.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Generates coverage reports (line, branch, function, statement)
- Identifies critical uncovered code paths
- Prioritizes coverage gaps by risk/importance
- Automatically generates tests for uncovered code
- Tracks coverage trends over time
- Enforces coverage thresholds

## Step 1: Detect Test Framework and Coverage Tool

**Identify coverage tooling**:

```bash
# Check package.json for coverage tools
if grep -q "jest" package.json; then
  FRAMEWORK="jest"
  COVERAGE_CMD="npm test -- --coverage"
elif grep -q "vitest" package.json; then
  FRAMEWORK="vitest"
  COVERAGE_CMD="npm run test:coverage"
elif grep -q "c8\|nyc" package.json; then
  FRAMEWORK="mocha"
  COVERAGE_CMD="nyc npm test"
elif grep -q "pytest-cov" requirements.txt; then
  FRAMEWORK="pytest"
  COVERAGE_CMD="pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"
elif grep -q "coverage" go.mod; then
  FRAMEWORK="go"
  COVERAGE_CMD="go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./..."
else
  echo "No coverage tool detected. Would you like to install one?"
  echo "1) Jest (JavaScript/TypeScript)"
  echo "2) pytest-cov (Python)"
  echo "3) go test -cover (Go)"
fi
```

## Step 2: Generate Coverage Report

**Run tests with coverage**:

```bash
echo "Running tests with coverage analysis..."

# JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest)
npm test -- --coverage --coverage-reporters=text --coverage-reporters=json --coverage-reporters=lcov

# Python
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json --cov-report=html

# Go
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Save coverage data
COVERAGE_FILE="coverage/coverage-final.json"
```

## Step 3: Analyze Coverage Data

**Parse coverage report**:

```javascript
const coverageData = await Read({
  file_path: 'coverage/coverage-final.json'
})

const coverage = JSON.parse(coverageData)

// Calculate overall coverage
const summary = {
  lines: {
    covered: 0,
    total: 0,
    percentage: 0
  },
  branches: {
    covered: 0,
    total: 0,
    percentage: 0
  },
  functions: {
    covered: 0,
    total: 0,
    percentage: 0
  },
  statements: {
    covered: 0,
    total: 0,
    percentage: 0
  }
}

// Aggregate across all files
for (const [filePath, fileCoverage] of Object.entries(coverage)) {
  summary.lines.covered += fileCoverage.lines.covered
  summary.lines.total += fileCoverage.lines.total
  summary.branches.covered += fileCoverage.branches.covered
  summary.branches.total += fileCoverage.branches.total
  // ... etc
}

// Calculate percentages
summary.lines.percentage = (summary.lines.covered / summary.lines.total) * 100
summary.branches.percentage = (summary.branches.covered / summary.branches.total) * 100
```

## Step 4: Identify Coverage Gaps

**Find uncovered code**:

```javascript
const gaps = {
  critical: [],    // Critical business logic uncovered
  important: [],   // Important features uncovered
  moderate: [],    // Standard code uncovered
  low: []         // Utility/simple code uncovered
}

for (const [filePath, fileCoverage] of Object.entries(coverage)) {
  // Skip test files and generated code
  if (filePath.includes('.test.') || filePath.includes('generated/')) {
    continue
  }

  const uncoveredLines = []
  const uncoveredBranches = []

  // Find uncovered lines
  for (const [lineNum, hits] of Object.entries(fileCoverage.s)) {
    if (hits === 0) {
      uncoveredLines.push(parseInt(lineNum))
    }
  }

  // Find uncovered branches
  for (const [branchId, branch] of Object.entries(fileCoverage.b)) {
    const uncoveredPaths = branch.filter(hits => hits === 0)
    if (uncoveredPaths.length > 0) {
      uncoveredBranches.push(branchId)
    }
  }

  if (uncoveredLines.length > 0 || uncoveredBranches.length > 0) {
    // Categorize by priority
    const priority = determineFilePriority(filePath)

    gaps[priority].push({
      file: filePath,
      uncoveredLines,
      uncoveredBranches,
      coverage: fileCoverage.lines.pct
    })
  }
}

function determineFilePriority(filePath) {
  // Critical: payment, auth, security
  if (/payment|auth|security|billing/i.test(filePath)) {
    return 'critical'
  }

  // Important: core business logic
  if (/service|controller|repository|api/i.test(filePath)) {
    return 'important'
  }

  // Moderate: UI components, utilities
  if (/component|util|helper/i.test(filePath)) {
    return 'moderate'
  }

  return 'low'
}
```

## Step 5: Display Coverage Report

**Generate comprehensive report**:

  📊 Branch Coverage Needs Attention:
     • 116 uncovered branches (27.1%)
     • Focus on conditional logic and error handling
     • Priority files: paymentService, authService, webhooks

  🔄 Suggested Next Steps:
     1. Generate tests for critical gaps (3 files)
     2. Add error scenario tests (6 files)
     3. Improve branch coverage in conditionals
     4. Set up coverage enforcement (fail below 80%)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

WOULD YOU LIKE TO AUTO-GENERATE TESTS?

Options:
  [1] Generate tests for ALL critical gaps (3 files)
  [2] Generate tests for specific file
  [3] Generate tests for uncovered lines only
  [4] Show detailed coverage for specific file
  [5] Export coverage report (HTML, JSON, LCOV)
  [6] Exit

Select option: _
```

## Step 6: Auto-Generate Missing Tests

**Generate tests for uncovered code**:

```javascript
async function generateMissingTests(file, uncoveredLines) {
  // Read source file
  const sourceCode = await Read({ file_path: file })

  // Extract uncovered code sections
  const uncoveredSections = extractUncoveredCode(sourceCode, uncoveredLines)

  // Generate tests using AI
  const prompt = `
Analyze this file and generate tests for uncovered code:

FILE: ${file}
CURRENT COVERAGE: ${fileCoverage}%
TARGET COVERAGE: 80%+

SOURCE CODE:
\`\`\`typescript
${sourceCode}
\`\`\`

UNCOVERED LINES: ${uncoveredLines.join(', ')}

UNCOVERED CODE SECTIONS:
${uncoveredSections.map((section, idx) => `
Section ${idx + 1} (lines ${section.start}-${section.end}):
\`\`\`typescript
${section.code}
\`\`\`
`).join('\n')}

Please generate comprehensive tests that:
1. Cover all uncovered lines
2. Test all branches (if/else, switch, ternary)
3. Test error scenarios
4. Test edge cases
5. Use appropriate mocks for dependencies
6. Follow existing test patterns in the project

Requirements:
- Generate tests that increase coverage to 80%+
- Focus on meaningful tests (not just coverage for coverage's sake)
- Include clear test names and comments
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
  `

  const generatedTests = await generateWithAI(prompt)

  return generatedTests
}
```

## Step 7: Validate Coverage Improvement

**Run tests and verify coverage increased**:

```bash
# Run tests again with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Calculate coverage difference
echo "Coverage before: ${BEFORE_COVERAGE}%"
echo "Coverage after: ${AFTER_COVERAGE}%"
echo "Improvement: +$(bc <<< "$AFTER_COVERAGE - $BEFORE_COVERAGE")%"

# Verify target reached
if (( $(bc <<< "$AFTER_COVERAGE >= 80") )); then
  echo "✓ Target coverage (80%) achieved!"
else
  echo "⚠ Coverage still below target. Need additional tests."
fi
```

## Step 8: Set Up Coverage Enforcement

**Configure coverage thresholds**:

```json
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 75,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    },
    // Per-file thresholds
    './src/services/paymentService.ts': {
      branches: 90,
      functions: 95,
      lines: 90,
      statements: 90
    },
    './src/services/authService.ts': {
      branches: 90,
      functions: 95,
      lines: 90,
      statements: 90
    }
  }
}
```

**Add pre-commit hook**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .husky/pre-commit

echo "Running tests with coverage..."
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text-summary

# Extract coverage percentage
COVERAGE=$(npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=json-summary 2>&1 | grep -o '"lines":{"total":[0-9]*,"covered":[0-9]*,"skipped":[0-9]*,"pct":[0-9.]*' | grep -o 'pct":[0-9.]*' | cut -d: -f2)

if (( $(bc <<< "$COVERAGE < 80") )); then
  echo "❌ Coverage is below 80% ($COVERAGE%)"
  echo "Please add tests before committing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ Coverage check passed ($COVERAGE%)"
```

## Step 9: Track Coverage Over Time

**Store coverage history**:

```bash
# Save coverage snapshot
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
mkdir -p coverage/history

cp coverage/coverage-summary.json "coverage/history/coverage_${TIMESTAMP}.json"

# Generate trend report
node scripts/generateCoverageTrend.js
```

**Generate trend visualization**:

```javascript
// scripts/generateCoverageTrend.js
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')

const historyDir = 'coverage/history'
const files = fs.readdirSync(historyDir)

const trend = files.map(file => {
  const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(historyDir, file)))
  const timestamp = file.match(/coverage_(\d{8}_\d{6})/)[1]

  return {
    timestamp,
    coverage: data.total.lines.pct
  }
}).sort((a, b) => a.timestamp.localeCompare(b.timestamp))

console.log('Coverage Trend:')
console.log('===============')
trend.forEach(({ timestamp, coverage }) => {
  const date = `${timestamp.slice(0, 4)}-${timestamp.slice(4, 6)}-${timestamp.slice(6, 8)}`
  const bars = '█'.repeat(Math.floor(coverage / 5))
  console.log(`${date}: ${coverage.toFixed(1)}% ${bars}`)
})
```
