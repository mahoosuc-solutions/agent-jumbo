## Best Practices

### Before Running This Command

**1. Prepare Product Information**:

```text
Have ready:
- Clear product description (1-2 sentences)
- Top 3 benefits
- Primary target customer
- Key differentiators vs. competitors
- Price point
- Any existing campaign data (CAC, conversion rates)
```

**2. Define Success Criteria**:

```text
Know your targets:
- What is acceptable CAC?
- What is your LTV (lifetime value)?
- What ROAS do you need? (LTV/CAC ratio)
- How many conversions/month is success?
```

**3. Set Up Ad Accounts** (optional but recommended):

```sql
Create accounts in advance:
- Facebook Business Manager
- Google Ads account
- LinkedIn Campaign Manager
- (Twitter/TikTok if using)
```

### After Campaign Generation

**1. Review Strategy First**:

```text
Priority order:
1. Read strategy/channel-strategy.md (10 min)
2. Validate budget allocation makes sense for your business
3. Check timeline aligns with launch goals
4. Verify KPIs are measurable
```

**2. Customize Creative if Needed**:

```text
Creative is 80% ready, but you may want to:
- Adjust tone/voice to match brand closer
- Add specific customer testimonials
- Include product-specific stats/data
- Swap visual concepts if needed
```

**3. Test Landing Pages**:

```text
Before launching ads:
- Deploy landing-page-a.html to your site
- Test on mobile (50%+ traffic is mobile)
- Verify forms submit correctly
- Check page load speed (<3 seconds)
- Install tracking pixels and test
```

**4. Phase Launch (Recommended)**:

```text
Week 1: Launch anchor platform only (Facebook or Google)
Week 2: Add 1-2 growth platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn)
Week 3-4: Add test platforms (Twitter, TikTok)

Why? Easier to manage, learn faster, reduce risk
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Budget seems too low for all platforms**

```text
Solution:
- Use --platforms flag to focus on 2-3 platforms
- Example: --platforms "facebook,google"
- Start with anchor + 1 growth platform
- Scale to more platforms as you see ROI
```

**Issue: Creative doesn't match brand voice**

```text
Solution:
- Edit creative files in /creative/ directory
- Keep structure/format, adjust tone/wording
- Regenerate specific variants:
  /campaign:create [product] --creative-only --platform facebook --angle data-driven
```

**Issue: Need different product type**

```text
Solution:
- Use --product-type flag more specifically
- Options: saas-b2b, saas-b2c, ecommerce-physical, ecommerce-digital, services-local, services-online
- Example: --product-type saas-b2b
```

**Issue: Want to test multiple budget scenarios**

```text
Solution:
- Run command multiple times with different budgets
- Compare strategy recommendations
- Example:
  /campaign:create "Product" --budget 5000
  /campaign:create "Product" --budget 10000
  /campaign:create "Product" --budget 20000
```
