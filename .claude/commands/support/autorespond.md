Generate auto-response for ticket: **${ARGUMENTS}**

## AI-Powered Auto-Response

**Intelligent Response Generation**:

- Intent detection and classification
- Confidence scoring (0-100%)
- KB article matching
- Personalized response generation
- Sentiment-aware tone adjustment
- Fallback to human agent if low confidence

Routes to **agent-router**:

```javascript
await Task({
  subagent_type: 'agent-router',
  description: 'Generate automated support response',
  prompt: `Generate auto-response for ticket: ${TICKET_ID}

Confidence threshold: ${CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD || 0.80}

Execute intelligent auto-response workflow:

## 1. Fetch Ticket Context

\`\`\`bash
# Get ticket details
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tickets/\${TICKET_ID}" \\
  -H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken \${ZOHO_DESK_TOKEN}"

# Get ticket thread
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tickets/\${TICKET_ID}/threads" \\
  -H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken \${ZOHO_DESK_TOKEN}"

# Get customer context
curl "https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Contacts/\${CONTACT_ID}" \\
  -H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken \${ZOHO_TOKEN}"
\`\`\`

Extract:
- Ticket description
- Customer name and tier
- Previous ticket history
- Current sentiment
- Urgency indicators

## 2. Intent Detection

Analyze ticket to determine user intent:

**Common Intents** (with examples):

**Password Reset** (Confidence: High)
- "can't login"
- "forgot password"
- "password not working"
→ KB: How to reset password

**Billing Question** (Confidence: High)
- "when am I charged"
- "how much does it cost"
- "cancel subscription"
→ KB: Billing FAQ + Pricing page

**Feature Request** (Confidence: Medium)
- "can you add X"
- "would be nice to have Y"
- "any plans to support Z"
→ Response: Thank you, logged for product team

**Bug Report** (Confidence: Medium)
- "not working"
- "error message"
- "broken"
→ Response: Needs investigation, ask for details

**How-To Question** (Confidence: High)
- "how do I..."
- "where can I find..."
- "what's the process for..."
→ KB: Relevant how-to article

**Integration Help** (Confidence: Medium)
- "API documentation"
- "webhook setup"
- "third-party integration"
→ KB: API docs + Code examples

**Account Access** (Confidence: High)
- "can't access account"
- "permission denied"
- "need admin access"
→ Response: Escalate to admin

**Data Export** (Confidence: High)
- "download my data"
- "export to CSV"
- "get all my information"
→ KB: Data export guide

**Refund Request** (Confidence: High)
- "want a refund"
- "cancel and refund"
- "money back"
→ Response: Escalate to billing team (requires human)

**General Inquiry** (Confidence: Low)
- Vague or unclear intent
→ Response: Ask clarifying questions

## 3. Confidence Scoring

Score confidence in auto-response:

\`\`\`javascript
function calculateConfidence(intent, ticketData) {
  let confidence = 0.5; // Base confidence

  // Intent clarity (+0 to +0.3)
  if (strongKeywordMatch) confidence += 0.3;
  else if (weakKeywordMatch) confidence += 0.15;

  // KB article available? (+0 to +0.2)
  if (exactMatchKBArticle) confidence += 0.2;
  else if (relatedKBArticle) confidence += 0.1;

  // Customer history (+0 to +0.1)
  if (similarPreviousTickets && resolved) confidence += 0.1;

  // Ticket complexity (-0 to -0.2)
  if (multipleQuestions) confidence -= 0.1;
  if (customOrEdgeCase) confidence -= 0.2;

  // Sentiment (-0 to -0.15)
  if (frustrated || angry) confidence -= 0.15;

  return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, confidence));
}

const confidence = calculateConfidence(\${INTENT}, \${TICKET_DATA});
const confidencePercent = Math.round(confidence * 100);

console.log(\`Confidence: \${confidencePercent}%\`);
\`\`\`

**Confidence Thresholds**:
- **95-100%**: Auto-send immediately (password resets, KB lookups)
- **80-94%**: Send with "Was this helpful?" follow-up
- **70-79%**: Draft response, human reviews before sending
- **Below 70%**: Escalate to human agent

## 4. Search Knowledge Base

Find relevant KB articles:

\`\`\`bash
# Search KB for relevant articles
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/articles/search?searchStr=\${TICKET_KEYWORDS}" \\
  -H "Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken \${ZOHO_DESK_TOKEN}"

# Rank by relevance:
# 1. Title match (exact or partial)
# 2. Tag match
# 3. Category match
# 4. Content match
# 5. Popularity (view count, helpfulness)
\`\`\`

Select top 1-3 most relevant articles.

## 5. Generate Response

Create personalized response based on intent and KB articles:

**Example**:
"I understand how frustrating this must be, especially when you need to get work done. Let me help you resolve this right away."

**Happy Customer**:
- Friendly, casual tone
- Keep it brief
- Match their energy

**Example**:
"Great question! Here's exactly what you need..."

**Neutral Customer**:
- Professional, helpful tone
- Clear and concise
- No unnecessary fluff

**Example**:
"Thanks for reaching out. Here's how to..."

## 7. Decision: Auto-Send or Human Review?

Based on confidence score:

\`\`\`javascript
const threshold = \${CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD || 0.80};

if (confidence >= 0.95) {
  // AUTO-SEND: Very high confidence
  action = 'send_immediately';

} else if (confidence >= threshold) {
  // SEND WITH FOLLOW-UP: Good confidence
  action = 'send_with_followup';
  followupMessage = "Was this helpful? [Yes] [No, I need more help]";

} else if (confidence >= 0.70) {
  // DRAFT FOR REVIEW: Medium confidence
  action = 'draft_for_human_review';
  reviewNote = "AI generated response - please review before sending";

} else {
  // ESCALATE: Low confidence
  action = 'escalate_to_human';
  reason = "Complex question requiring human judgment";
}
\`\`\`

## 8. Execute Action

### If Auto-Send (Confidence ≥ 95%)

      "auto_responded": true,
      "ai_confidence": '\${CONFIDENCE}',
      "response_time_seconds": '\${RESPONSE_TIME}'
    }
  }'

echo "✓ Auto-response sent (confidence: \${CONFIDENCE}%)"
\`\`\`

### If Send with Follow-Up (Confidence 80-94%)

Send response + add follow-up check:

\`\`\`bash
# Send response
[Same as above]

# Schedule follow-up check (1 hour)
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tasks" \\
  -X POST \\
  -d '{
    "subject": "Check if auto-response resolved ticket #\${TICKET_ID}",
    "dueDate": "'\$(date -u -d '+1 hour' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
    "ticketId": "'\${TICKET_ID}'"
  }'
\`\`\`

### If Draft for Review (Confidence 70-79%)

Save as internal note for human review:

\`\`\`bash
# Add as private note (not sent to customer)
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tickets/\${TICKET_ID}/threads" \\
  -X POST \\
  -d '{
    "content": "AI-Generated Response (Confidence: \${CONFIDENCE}%): <br><br>\${RESPONSE_CONTENT}",
    "contentType": "html",

    "isPublic": false
  }'

# Assign to appropriate team
curl "https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tickets/\${TICKET_ID}" \\
  -X PATCH \\
  -d '{
    "assigneeId": "'\${AGENT_ID}'",
    "status": "Open"
  }'

echo "✓ Escalated to human agent"
\`\`\`

## 9. Track Performance

  tickets_analyzed: \${TOTAL_TICKETS},
  auto_sent: \${AUTO_SENT_COUNT},
  human_reviewed: \${HUMAN_REVIEW_COUNT},
  escalated: \${ESCALATED_COUNT},

  avg_confidence: \${AVG_CONFIDENCE},

  resolution_rate: {
    auto_sent: \${AUTO_RESOLVED_COUNT} / \${AUTO_SENT_COUNT}, // Target: 70-80%
    overall: \${TOTAL_RESOLVED} / \${TOTAL_TICKETS} // Target: 40-50%
  },

  customer_satisfaction: {
    auto_responses: \${CSAT_AUTO}, // Target: > 4.0/5
    human_responses: \${CSAT_HUMAN} // Comparison

Confidence: 65%
Reason: Complex multi-step issue, needs engineering investigation

Suggested response available, but requires human review before sending.
```

## Success Criteria

- ✓ Intent detected with confidence score
- ✓ KB articles searched and ranked
- ✓ Response generated (personalized, tone-adjusted)
- ✓ Action taken based on confidence (auto-send/draft/escalate)
- ✓ Performance tracked (resolution rate, CSAT)
- ✓ Report saved
- ✓ Auto-resolution rate: 40-50% of tickets
- ✓ CSAT for auto-responses: > 4.0/5
- ✓ Time savings: 85-95% (30 seconds vs 15 minutes)

## ROI Calculation

**Current State (No Auto-Response)**:

- 500 tickets/month
- 15 min average response time
- Cost: 500 × 15 min = 125 hours/month
- At $50/hour = $6,250/month

**With Auto-Response** (50% automation):

- 250 tickets auto-responded (30 seconds each)
- 250 tickets human-responded (15 min each)
- Cost: (250 × 0.5 min) + (250 × 15 min) = 63.5 hours/month
- At $50/hour = $3,175/month
- **Savings**: $3,075/month = **$36,900/year**

**Time Savings**: 61.5 hours/month = **50% reduction**
