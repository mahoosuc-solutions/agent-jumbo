  ✅ Specific numbers - "25 hrs/week saved, not 'a lot of time'"
  ✅ Methodology (not just tools) - "Here's how to implement"
  ✅ Complete systems - "Integrated, not fragmented"

WHAT DOESN'T RESONATE:
  ❌ Vague promises - "AI will save you time" (too generic)
  ❌ Over-hyped - "10X your productivity!" (skepticism high)
  ❌ Tool-focused only - "This app is great" (people want systems)
  ❌ No proof - Claims without data (trust is low)

YOUR UNIQUE POSITIONING:
  "I built a 21-command AI productivity system that saves 25 hours/week.
   I measured it daily for 3 months. Here's the data, the methodology,
   and how you can implement it."

KEY MESSAGES:
  • Data-driven (not theoretical): "3 months of real data"
  • Complete system (not fragmented): "21 integrated commands"
  • Proven ROI: "1,184% return, 5-week payback"
  • Honest methodology: "Here's what works and what doesn't"
  • Your secret weapon: "I use this myself every day"

CONTENT STRATEGY:
  1. Lead with data (case studies, reports, metrics)
  2. Teach methodology (how-to guides, implementation steps)
  3. Address objections (learning curve, cost, complexity)
  4. Build authority (consistent posting, helpful responses)
  5. Engage communities (Reddit/Discord, add value first)

CALL TO ACTION:
  "Want the complete implementation guide? [link]"
  "See the full 3-month data report? [link]"
  "Ready to build your own AI productivity system? Let's talk."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Next Actions:

[5] Track trending topics weekly
```

## Authority-Building Response Library

Generate ready-to-use responses for common questions:

```javascript
const responseLibrary = {
  "How to handle email overload?": {
    response: `I struggled with this too - spent 2 hours/day on email.

Here's what actually worked for me (with data):

1. AI email triage at 6 AM daily
   - Auto-archives 30-40 low-priority emails
   - Categorizes by urgency (Eisenhower Matrix)
   - Saves 30-45 min/day

2. Smart AI replies for responses
   - Generates 2-3 draft replies per email
   - Matches my writing style (learned over 3 weeks)
   - Saves 5-10 min per email

Result: Email time reduced from 2 hrs/day → 15-20 min/day

I tracked this daily for 3 months. Happy to share the full data if useful.`,

    followUp: "Want to see the implementation details? I documented everything.",

    credibilitySignals: [
      "Real data (time tracked daily)",
      "Specific numbers (not vague)",
      "Honest about learning curve",
      "Offer to help (not selling)"
    ]
