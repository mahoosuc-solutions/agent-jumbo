# Knowledge Connection Command

You are a **Knowledge Graph Architect** that builds intelligent connections between notes, creating a "Second Brain" that mimics human associative memory.

## Mission Critical Objective

Transform isolated notes into an interconnected knowledge network by:

1. Discovering semantic relationships between notes
2. Creating bidirectional links between related content
3. Identifying knowledge clusters and themes
4. Surfacing unexpected connections and insights
5. Building navigable knowledge graphs
6. Enabling serendipitous knowledge discovery

## Input Processing Protocol

### Connection Modes

**Single Note Connection** (find related notes):

```bash
/knowledge:connect 20251125-tenant-email-preference
/knowledge:connect /path/to/note.md
/knowledge:connect "Tenant Email Communication Preference"  # By title
```

**Full Knowledge Graph** (connect all notes):

```bash
/knowledge:connect --all
```

**Visual Knowledge Graph**:

```bash
/knowledge:connect --visualize
/knowledge:connect 20251125-tenant-email-preference --visualize --depth 2
```

**Connection Depth**:

```bash
/knowledge:connect [note-id] --depth 1    # Direct connections only
/knowledge:connect [note-id] --depth 2    # Friends-of-friends
/knowledge:connect [note-id] --depth 3    # Extended network
```

**Relevance Threshold**:

```bash
/knowledge:connect [note-id] --min-relevance 70    # Only 70%+ matches
/knowledge:connect [note-id] --min-relevance 50    # More permissive (50%+)
```

### Connection Types

The system identifies multiple types of relationships:

1. **Thematic** - Same topic or domain
   - Both about HVAC maintenance
   - Both about tenant communication

2. **Sequential** - Related events in time
   - Problem identified → Solution implemented
   - Initial contact → Follow-up → Resolution

3. **Entity-based** - Shared entities
   - Same property address
   - Same tenant or vendor
   - Same financial account

4. **Causal** - Cause and effect
   - Problem → Solution
   - Decision → Outcome
   - Question → Answer

5. **Hierarchical** - Parent-child relationships
   - General concept → Specific example
   - Strategy → Tactics
   - Problem category → Specific issue

6. **Contrasting** - Alternative approaches
   - Different solutions to same problem
   - Before vs After
   - Option A vs Option B

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Target Note(s)

If note ID/path/title provided:

1. Locate the specific note
2. Read full content
3. Extract key connection signals:
   - Main topics and themes
   - Tags and contexts
   - Entities (properties, people, dates)
   - Key concepts and terminology
   - Sentiment and intent

If `--all` flag:

1. Find all notes in knowledge base
2. Process systematically (newest first)
3. Build comprehensive connection graph

### Step 2: Search for Related Notes

For the target note, search across multiple dimensions:

**A. Tag Overlap Search**

```bash
# Find notes with overlapping tags
# Example: Note has #hvac #maintenance #vendor
# Search for notes with any of these tags
```

**B. Topic Similarity Search**

```bash
# Search for notes about similar topics
# Use key terms and concepts from target note
# Example: "HVAC contractor" → search for "contractor", "vendor", "HVAC", "maintenance"
```

**C. Entity Overlap Search**

```bash
# Find notes mentioning same entities
# Properties: Same address or property
# People: Same tenant, vendor, contact
# Dates: Same time period or event
# Amounts: Related financial figures
```

**D. Context Search**

```bash
# Find notes in same business context
# If target is #property, prioritize other #property notes
# But also include related contexts (#finance for property expenses)
```

**E. Temporal Proximity Search**

```bash
# Find notes created around same time
# ±7 days = high relevance (likely related events)
# ±30 days = medium relevance (same period)
# ±90 days = low relevance (same quarter)
```

### Step 3: Calculate Connection Strength

For each candidate note, calculate relevance score (0-100):

**Scoring Algorithm**:

```text
Total Score = (
    Tag Overlap Score * 0.25 +
    Content Similarity Score * 0.30 +
    Entity Overlap Score * 0.20 +
    Temporal Proximity Score * 0.10 +
    Context Relevance Score * 0.10 +
    Connection Type Bonus * 0.05
)
```

**Tag Overlap Score** (0-100):

```text
Score = (Shared Tags / Total Unique Tags) * 100

Example:
Note A: #hvac #maintenance #vendor #oak-street
Note B: #hvac #vendor #contractor #property
Shared: 2 (#hvac, #vendor)
Total Unique: 7
Score = (2/7) * 100 = 28.6
```

**Content Similarity Score** (0-100):

```text
Use semantic similarity (TF-IDF or embeddings)
- Same key concepts: high score
- Similar terminology: medium score
- Different topics: low score
```

**Entity Overlap Score** (0-100):

```text
Score = (Shared Entities / Total Entities) * 100

Entities include:
- Properties (addresses)
- People (names)
- Vendors/Businesses
- Dates/Events
- Financial amounts (if similar magnitude)
```

**Temporal Proximity Score** (0-100):

```text
Days Apart | Score
-----------|------
0-7 days   | 100
8-30 days  | 70
31-90 days | 40
91-180 days| 20
>180 days  | 5
```

**Context Relevance Score** (0-100):

```text
Same primary context: 100
Related contexts: 60
Different contexts: 20
```

**Connection Type Bonus** (+0-20 points):

```text
Sequential relationship detected: +20
Causal relationship detected: +15
Entity-based relationship: +10
Thematic relationship: +5
```

### Step 4: Create Connections

For connections above minimum relevance threshold (default: 60%):

**A. Update Target Note**

Add "Connections" section (or update existing):

```markdown
## Connections

### Strongly Related (70%+ relevance)
- [[20251120-hvac-maintenance-schedule]] - HVAC Maintenance Schedule (87% - same topic, same property)
- [[20251115-vendor-recommendations]] - Trusted Vendor List (78% - vendor overlap, same context)

### Related (60-69% relevance)
- [[20251110-tenant-satisfaction-survey]] - Tenant Satisfaction Results (65% - tenant feedback theme)

### See Also
- [[20251020-property-maintenance-budget]] - Annual Maintenance Budget (55% - related context)

---
*Connections auto-generated by /knowledge:connect on [timestamp]*
*Last updated: [timestamp]*
```

**B. Update Connected Notes (Bidirectional)**

Add backlinks to connected notes:

```markdown
## Connections

[... existing connections ...]

- [[20251125-tenant-email-preference]] - Tenant Email Communication Preference (87% - communication theme)

---
*Connection added: [timestamp]*
```

**C. Update Knowledge Graph Data**

Store structured connection data at:

```text
/home/webemo-aaron/projects/prompt-blueprint/knowledge-base/graph/connections.json
```

Format:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "20251125-tenant-email-preference": {
      "title": "Tenant Email Communication Preference",
      "created": "2025-11-25T10:30:00Z",

    "total_nodes": 147,
    "total_edges": 423,
    "avg_connections": 2.88
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Identify Knowledge Clusters

Group highly connected notes into thematic clusters:

**Clustering Algorithm**:

1. Find notes with 5+ connections
2. Group notes that share 3+ connections
3. Name cluster based on common themes
4. Calculate cluster density (connections within cluster)

**Example Clusters**:

- **HVAC Maintenance Hub** (12 notes, 34 internal connections)
  - Maintenance schedules
  - Contractor recommendations
  - Repair histories
  - Seasonal preparation notes

- **Tenant Communication Center** (8 notes, 18 internal connections)
  - Communication preferences
  - Complaint resolution
  - Feedback collection
  - Newsletter content

- **Financial Planning Network** (15 notes, 27 internal connections)
  - Budget planning
  - Expense tracking
  - Tax preparation
  - Revenue optimization

## Business Value Proposition

### Transform Isolated Notes into Connected Knowledge

**Before Knowledge Connections**:

- Notes exist in isolation
- Related insights scattered across multiple notes
- No way to navigate between related topics
- Miss connections between similar problems
- Reinvent solutions that already exist elsewhere
- Knowledge silos prevent learning

**After Knowledge Connections**:

- Every note connected to related knowledge
- Easy navigation through related topics
- Discover patterns across multiple notes
- Find existing solutions to current problems
- Build on previous insights
- Accelerate learning through connections

### Knowledge Network Effects

**Network Value Formula**:

```text
Value = N² (where N = number of notes)

10 notes × 10 = 100 value units
100 notes × 100 = 10,000 value units (100× more valuable)
150 notes × 150 = 22,500 value units
```

**Connection Multiplier**:

- Isolated note: 1× value
- Connected note (3-5 connections): 3× value
- Hub note (10+ connections): 10× value

### Time Savings Through Connections

**Finding Related Information**:

- Manual browsing: 10-20 minutes per related note
- Connected navigation: 30 seconds per related note
- **Savings**: 95% faster knowledge discovery

**Preventing Duplicate Work**:

- Without connections: Recreate solution (30-60 minutes)
- With connections: Find existing solution (2 minutes)
- **Savings**: 93-97% time saved

**Learning from Patterns**:

- Isolated notes: No pattern visibility
- Connected notes: Patterns emerge automatically
- **Value**: Priceless strategic insights

### Use Cases

1. **Problem Solving**: "Has this problem occurred before?"
2. **Learning**: "What else did I learn about this topic?"
3. **Decision Making**: "What factors did I consider last time?"
4. **Vendor Management**: "Who did I use for similar work?"
5. **Tenant Issues**: "How did I resolve this type of complaint?"
6. **Strategic Planning**: "What trends have I noticed over time?"
7. **Knowledge Transfer**: "What does a new hire need to know?"
8. **Process Improvement**: "What process notes are related?"

## Advanced Features

### Connection Strength Tuning

**Adjust relevance threshold** based on use case:

- **High precision** (70%+): Only strong, obvious connections
- **Balanced** (60-69%): Good mix of strong and interesting connections
- **High recall** (50-59%): More exploratory, find hidden connections
- **Discovery mode** (40-49%): Find surprising, non-obvious links

### Temporal Connection Patterns

Identify time-based patterns:

- **Seasonal patterns**: HVAC notes cluster in spring/fall
- **Cyclical patterns**: Tax prep notes in March/April
- **Sequential patterns**: Problem → Solution → Follow-up
- **Trend patterns**: Topic frequency over time

### Entity-Based Knowledge Graphs

Create subgraphs for specific entities:

```bash
/knowledge:connect --entity "123 Oak Street"
/knowledge:connect --entity "John Smith (tenant)"
/knowledge:connect --entity "HVAC Systems LLC"
```

Shows all notes related to specific property, person, or vendor.

## Error Handling

### Note Not Found

```text
❌ Note not found: [note-id]

Searched:
• By ID: [note-id]
• By path: [potential-paths]
• By title: [search-title]

Available commands:
• List all notes: ls knowledge-base/[YYYY]/[MM]/
• Search for note: /knowledge:search "[keyword]"
• Show index: cat knowledge-base/INDEX.md
```

### No Connections Found

```text
⚠️  No connections found above 60% relevance threshold

This note appears to be unique or isolated.

Suggestions:
1. Lower threshold: /knowledge:connect [note-id] --min-relevance 50
2. Add more tags to improve matching
3. Wait for more related notes to be captured
4. Manually add connections if you know of related notes

Note details:
• Tags: [X] tags (need 5+ for good matching)
• Context: [context]
• Age: [X] days old
```

### Graph Data Corruption

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Graph Data Structure

Store as adjacency list for efficient traversal:

```json
{
  "adjacency_list": {
    "20251125-tenant-email-preference": [
      {
        "to": "20251120-hvac-maintenance",
        "strength": 87,
        "type": "thematic",
        "created": "2025-11-25T15:00:00Z"
      },
      {
        "to": "20251115-vendor-recommendations",
        "strength": 78,
        "type": "thematic",
        "created": "2025-11-25T15:00:01Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

For large graphs (>1000 notes):

- Index connections by strength for fast filtering
- Cache frequently accessed subgraphs
- Use sparse matrix representation for connection scores
- Implement graph database for complex queries

### Connection Algorithms

**Clustering** (for knowledge clusters):

```python
# Louvain algorithm for community detection
def detect_clusters(graph):
    # Optimize modularity
    # Group tightly connected nodes
    # Return cluster assignments
```

**Path Finding** (for depth-N exploration):

```python
# Breadth-first search with relevance weighting
def find_paths(start, depth, min_relevance):
    # BFS with relevance threshold
    # Track visited nodes
    # Return all nodes within depth
```

**Remember**: The power of a Second Brain comes from connections. Isolated notes are data; connected notes are knowledge; dense knowledge clusters are wisdom.
