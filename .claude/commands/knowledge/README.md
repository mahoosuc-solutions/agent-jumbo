# Knowledge Management System - "Second Brain"

A comprehensive knowledge management system for solo entrepreneurs to never lose insights again.

## Overview

The `/knowledge` command suite transforms how you capture, organize, search, and learn from your business knowledge. Built for property managers, solopreneurs, and anyone who can't afford to lose critical insights.

## Commands

### 1. `/knowledge:capture` - Quick Note Capture

**Usage**:

```bash
# Text notes
/knowledge:capture "Tenant mentioned they prefer email for maintenance updates"

# Screenshots with OCR
/knowledge:capture ~/Downloads/property-tax-notice.png --priority high

# Voice notes (transcription)
/knowledge:capture "Quick thought: automate rent reminders 3 days before due date"

# PDF documents
/knowledge:capture ~/Documents/lease-agreement.pdf --context property

## Best Practices

### Capture Discipline

1. **Capture immediately** - Don't trust memory, capture in the moment
2. **Lower the bar** - Quick captures better than perfect notes
3. **Multiple formats** - Use whatever is easiest (voice, screenshot, text)
4. **Context always** - Note where/when insight occurred

### Search Effectively

1. **Start broad, narrow down** - Begin with general terms, refine
2. **Use context filters** - Narrow to business area when relevant
3. **Follow connections** - Explore related notes
4. **Check recent first** - Recent notes often most relevant

### Organize Regularly

1. **Weekly organization** - Prevent accumulation of clutter
2. **Monthly deep clean** - Consolidate duplicates, archive old items
3. **Review health scores** - Maintain >85% knowledge health
4. **Connect new notes** - Run connect after capturing batches

### Review Consistently

1. **Daily digest** - End of day, 5 minutes
2. **Weekly insights** - Sunday planning, 15-20 minutes
3. **Monthly strategic** - End of month, 30-45 minutes
4. **Act on insights** - Implementation is where value comes from

## Advanced Tips

### Power User Techniques

- **Chain commands**: Capture → Connect → Search related
- **Batch processing**: Capture multiple notes, then organize all
- **Custom periods**: Use date ranges for project-specific reviews
- **Export for external tools**: Use `--format raw` for file paths

### Integration Ideas

- **Morning planning**: Review daily digest, prioritize day
- **Weekly review**: Digest + organize + strategic planning
- **Decision making**: Search for past similar decisions
- **Learning loops**: Monthly digest reveals what you're learning

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily** (5 min): Capture + quick review
- **Weekly** (20 min): Organize + weekly digest + planning
- **Monthly** (45 min): Deep organization + monthly digest + strategy
- **Quarterly** (90 min): Comprehensive review + system optimization

## Philosophy

> "The best time to capture knowledge was when you first learned it. The second best time is now."

The Second Brain system is built on three principles:

1. **Capture Everything**: Trust the system, not your memory
2. **Connect Relentlessly**: Isolated notes are data; connected notes are knowledge
3. **Review Regularly**: Unreviewed knowledge is wasted knowledge

Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Let your Second Brain remember so you can focus on creating value.
