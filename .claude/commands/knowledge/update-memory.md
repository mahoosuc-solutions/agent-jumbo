# /knowledge:update-memory

Update Serena memory: **${ARGUMENTS:-interactive mode}**

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments and Determine Mode

Understand what memory operation is requested:

<commentary>
Three modes:
1. Direct update: memory name provided
2. Create new: --create flag with name
3. Search and update: --search flag with query
4. Interactive: no args (guide user through process)
</commentary>

1. Check if memory name is provided as argument
2. Check for flags:
   - `--create`: Create new memory file
   - `--search <query>`: Find existing memory to update
3. If no args, enter interactive mode

---

## Step 2: List Existing Memories

Show available memory files to user:

Use the `list_memories` tool to get all available memories.

Display in organized format:

```text
📚 Available Serena Memories:

Project Architecture:
- architecture-overview.md
- design-decisions.md
- technology-stack.md

Patterns & Conventions:
- coding-patterns.md
- api-design-patterns.md
- testing-conventions.md

Tools & Dependencies:
- development-tools.md
- deployment-process.md
- third-party-integrations.md

Project Context:
- business-logic.md
- domain-knowledge.md
- troubleshooting-guide.md

Total: ${memoryCount} memory files
```

---

## Step 3: Interactive Mode - Gather Knowledge

If in interactive mode, ask user what they want to document:

<commentary>
Use AskUserQuestion to understand what knowledge needs to be captured.
This helps users who may not know exactly what to document.
</commentary>

Ask:

```text
What type of knowledge would you like to add to Serena's memory?

Options:
1. Architectural Decision
   - Why we chose a specific technology, pattern, or approach
   - Trade-offs considered
   - Alternatives evaluated

2. Pattern or Convention
   - Code patterns to follow
   - Naming conventions
   - File organization rules
   - Best practices

3. Tool or Dependency
   - How to use a specific tool
   - Configuration requirements
   - Common issues and solutions

4. Project-Specific Context
   - Business domain knowledge
   - Customer requirements
   - Project constraints
   - Stakeholder information

5. Troubleshooting Guide
   - Common errors and fixes
   - Debugging procedures
   - Performance optimization tips

6. Other (Specify)
```

---

## Step 4: Determine Target Memory File

Based on knowledge type, suggest appropriate memory file:

<commentary>
Map knowledge types to memory files:
- Architectural Decision → design-decisions.md or architecture-overview.md
- Pattern/Convention → coding-patterns.md or api-design-patterns.md
- Tool/Dependency → development-tools.md or third-party-integrations.md
- Project Context → business-logic.md or domain-knowledge.md
- Troubleshooting → troubleshooting-guide.md
</commentary>

If memory file exists:

```text
📝 Suggested memory file: ${suggestedMemory}

This file currently contains:
- ${existingTopics.length} topics
- Last updated: ${lastUpdated}

Options:
1. Add to this file (recommended)
2. Create new file
3. Choose different existing file
```

If memory doesn't exist:

```text
📝 Creating new memory file: ${memoryName}

This will be a new memory file for ${category}.
```

---

## Step 5: Read Current Memory Content

If updating existing memory, read current content:

Use `read_memory` tool to get current content.

Show user a summary:

```text
📖 Current content of ${memoryName}:

Structure:
${toc}

Recent additions:
${recentSections}

Total sections: ${sectionCount}
```

---

## Step 6: Gather New Knowledge Content

Ask user to provide the knowledge to document:

<commentary>
Guide user to provide structured information.
For architectural decisions, use ADR format.
For patterns, provide examples.
For troubleshooting, include symptoms, causes, solutions.
</commentary>

Depending on knowledge type:

### For Architectural Decisions

```text
Please provide the following information:

1. Decision Title
   (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB")

2. Context
   (What situation led to this decision?)

3. Decision

## Step 7: Format Content for Memory

Structure the content in markdown format:

<commentary>
Use clear headings, bullet points, code blocks.
Include date for traceability.
Add links to related memories.
</commentary>

Generate structured markdown:

```markdown
## ${Title}

**Added**: ${date}
**Category**: ${category}
**Related**: ${relatedMemories}

### Context
${context}

### ${Section1Title}
${section1Content}

### ${Section2Title}
${section2Content}

### Examples
\`\`\`${language}
${codeExample}
\`\`\`

### See Also
- [${relatedTopic1}](#${link1})
- [${relatedTopic2}](#${link2})

---
```

---

## Step 8: Show Preview and Confirm

Display preview of changes to user:

<commentary>
Show before/after diff or just new content if creating.
Use clear formatting so user can review.
</commentary>

If updating existing memory:

```text
📋 Preview of changes to ${memoryName}:

=== NEW CONTENT TO BE ADDED ===

${newContent}

=== END NEW CONTENT ===

This will be added to section: ${sectionName}

Confirm? (y/n)
```

If creating new memory:

```text
📋 Preview of new memory file ${memoryName}:

${fullContent}

Create this memory file? (y/n)
```

---

## Step 9: Apply Changes to Memory

Update or create the memory file:

<commentary>
Use write_memory for new files or small updates.
Use edit_memory for targeted updates to existing files.
</commentary>

If creating new memory:

```typescript
mcp__plugin_serena_serena__write_memory({
  memory_file_name: memoryName,
  content: formattedContent
});
```

If updating existing memory (append):

```typescript
mcp__plugin_serena_serena__write_memory({
  memory_file_name: memoryName,
  content: existingContent + '\n\n' + newContent
});
```

If updating existing memory (targeted edit):

```typescript
mcp__plugin_serena_serena__edit_memory({
  memory_file_name: memoryName,
  needle: sectionMarker,  // regex pattern
  repl: updatedSection,
  mode: 'regex'
});
```

---

## Step 10: Verify Update

Read back the memory to confirm changes:

Use `read_memory` to verify the update was applied correctly.

Show confirmation:

```text
✅ Memory updated successfully!

Memory file: ${memoryName}
Content added: ${addedLines} lines
Total size: ${totalLines} lines

Latest addition:
${latestSection}
```

---

## Step 11: Link Related Memories (Optional)

Ask if user wants to link to related memories:

<commentary>
Help build a knowledge graph by linking related topics.
This makes knowledge discovery easier later.
</commentary>

```text
Would you like to link this to related memories?

Related topics detected:
1. ${relatedMemory1} (${relevanceScore1}% relevant)
2. ${relatedMemory2} (${relevanceScore2}% relevant)
3. ${relatedMemory3} (${relevanceScore3}% relevant)

Add cross-references? (y/n)
```

If yes:

1. Add "See Also" links to current memory
2. Add backlinks to related memories

---

## Step 12: Suggest Regular Reviews

Remind user about memory maintenance:

```text
💡 Memory Maintenance Tips:

1. Review and update memories when context changes
2. Add new examples as they emerge in the codebase
3. Remove outdated information
4. Link related concepts
5. Run /knowledge:search to verify memories are discoverable

Next review suggested: ${suggestDate}

Set reminder? (y/n)
```

---

## Step 13: Summary

Display operation summary:

```markdown
# ✅ Memory Update Complete

## Updated Memory
📄 File: ${memoryName}
📊 Size: ${totalLines} lines (${changeType})
📅 Last updated: ${timestamp}

## Changes Made
${changeType === 'created' ? '🆕 New memory file created' : '➕ Content added to existing memory'}

### New Content Summary
- **Title**: ${title}
- **Category**: ${category}
- **Lines added**: ${addedLines}
- **Code examples**: ${exampleCount}
- **Cross-references**: ${linkCount}

## Related Memories
${relatedMemories.map(m => `- ${m.name} (${m.relation})`).join('\n')}

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Knowledge**
   Run: \`/knowledge:search "${keyTerm}"\`

2. **Share with Team**
   Memory files are in: \`.claude/memories/\`
   Commit changes: \`git add .claude/memories/ && git commit -m "docs: update ${memoryName}"\`

3. **Build on Knowledge**
   Add more examples as you encounter them
   Update when requirements change

## Quick Access
- View this memory: \`/knowledge:search ${memoryName}\`
- Update again: \`/knowledge:update-memory ${memoryName}\`
- All memories: \`/knowledge:search\`
