# /software-business:revenue - Financial Tracking & Analysis

Track monthly recurring revenue (MRR), annual recurring revenue (ARR), cash flow, profitability, and measure progress toward financial independence.

## Quick Start

**Track this month's revenue:**

```bash
/software-business:revenue track
```

**Forecast next 90 days:**

```bash
/software-business:revenue forecast
```

**Analyze profitability:**

```bash
/software-business:revenue analyze
```

**Check progress toward goals:**

```bash
/software-business:revenue goals
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **revenue-centric business tracking** where every dollar is:

1. Tracked by source (projects, retainers, products)
2. Measured for profitability (revenue vs. cost)
3. Linked to business goals ($200K/year, recurring revenue, etc.)
4. Evaluated for sustainability (can you maintain this?)

**Key Principle**: Revenue isn't profit. A $100K project might only generate $30K profit. The goal is to maximize profit while maintaining sustainable work hours.

---

## Mode 1: TRACK - Record Revenue & Expenses

Log revenue and expenses as they occur or monthly.

### Revenue Sources

**Project Revenue** (Non-recurring):

- Custom development projects
- One-time consulting engagements
- Implementation projects
- Training/workshops

**Retainer Revenue** (Recurring):

- Monthly maintenance contracts
- Retainer agreements
- Support contracts
- Ongoing advisory

**Product Revenue** (Recurring/one-time):

- SaaS product subscriptions
- Digital products (courses, templates, etc.)
- Affiliate revenue
- Sponsorships
