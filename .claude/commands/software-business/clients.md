# /software-business:clients - Client Relationship Management

Track clients through complete lifecycle: lead → proposal → active → completed, with communication history, contracts, and client value scoring.

## Quick Start

**Add a new lead:**

```bash
/software-business:clients add
```

**List all clients:**

```bash
/software-business:clients list
```

**Manage a specific client:**

```bash
/software-business:clients manage
```

**Log communication:**

```bash
/software-business:clients communicate
```

**Score client value:**

```bash
/software-business:clients score
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **client-centric CRM** where every client is:

1. Tracked through the complete sales pipeline
2. Evaluated for lifetime value (revenue potential)
3. Assessed for alignment with business goals
4. Measured for satisfaction and relationship quality

**Key Principle**: Not all clients are equal. Some clients are:

- Highly profitable (great margins)
- Low maintenance (good communication)
- Aligned with your goals (build product, get testimonials)
- Sources of referrals (network effect)

The system helps you identify high-value clients and nurture those relationships.
