# /software-business:team - Team Coordination & Capacity Management

Delegate tasks, track team member capacity, manage sprints, and measure team alignment with business goals.

## Quick Start

**Check team capacity:**

```bash
/software-business:team capacity
```

**Delegate a task:**

```bash
/software-business:team delegate
```

**Track task progress:**

```bash
/software-business:team track
```

**Review team performance:**

```bash
/software-business:team performance
```

**Align team with goals:**

```bash
/software-business:team goals
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **team-centric task management** where:

1. Every task has a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)
2. Capacity is tracked and managed (prevent burnout)
3. Performance is measured (quality, velocity, delivery)
4. Team work is aligned with business goals

**Key Principle**: A team is only as good as their ability to execute while maintaining quality and avoiding burnout. The goal is to maximize capacity without sacrificing happiness or output quality.

## Mode 1: CAPACITY - Track Team Member Availability

Monitor capacity, manage workload, and prevent overcommitment.

FORECASTED BOTTLENECKS
├── Q1: John at 100% capacity (monitor closely)
├── Q2: All developers at ~80% capacity (good buffer)
├── Q3: New project starts (will need to hire or reduce scope)
└── Action: Start recruiting for Q3 expansion (2+ month lead time)
```

### Capacity Rules & Best Practices

**Golden Rules**:

- Never allocate someone to 100% (need 15-20% buffer for:
  - Code review, mentoring, learning
  - Emergency firefighting
  - Unexpected delays
  - Well-being & burnout prevention

- Track actual hours vs. estimated (improves future estimates)
- Respect time zone boundaries (no 2am commits)
- Protect focused work time (no meeting-heavy days)

**Escalation Triggers**:

- Team member at 100%+ allocation → Immediate action
- Person working >50 hrs/week consistently → Talk to them
- Velocity dropping >15% → Check for burnout, blockers
- Quality issues appearing → Likely overloaded

---

## Mode 2: DELEGATE - Assign Work

Create tasks, delegate to team members, track progress.

### Task Template

```

### Delegation Best Practices

**Before delegating**:

1. Task is clear and scoped (not vague)
2. Person has capacity (not overloaded)
3. Person has skills (or clear growth opportunity)
4. Resources are provided (no blockers)
5. Success criteria are defined (how they know they're done)

**When delegating**:

1. Have 1-on-1 conversation (not just Slack)
2. Confirm understanding (ask them to repeat back)
3. Set clear timeline (due date is important)
4. Define DRI (who's responsible if it slips?)
5. Clarify communication (how often you'll sync)

**After delegating**:

1. Check in regularly (weekly for multi-week tasks)
2. Remove blockers (don't let them get stuck)
3. Provide feedback (positive & corrective)
4. Update status tracking (actual vs. estimated)
