# /software-business:projects - Project Management System

Track all projects with timelines, deliverables, time tracking, and profitability analysis aligned to business and life goals.

## Quick Start

**Create a new project:**

```bash
/software-business:projects create
```

**List all projects:**

```bash
/software-business:projects list
```

**Track project progress:**

```bash
/software-business:projects track
```

**Complete a project:**

```bash
/software-business:projects complete
```

**Analyze project profitability:**

```bash
/software-business:projects analyze
```

---

## System Overview

This command implements **project-centric business management** where every project is:

1. Linked to a specific client
2. Measured for profitability (revenue vs. time)
3. Evaluated against business goals
4. Aligned with life goals (work-life balance)

**Key Principle**: A project is only "successful" if it:

- Delivers value to client (on time, on budget)
- Generates profit (revenue > cost)
- Aligns with business goals ($200K/year, build product, etc.)
- Respects life goals (≤40 hrs/week, high autonomy, etc.)

---

## Mode 1: CREATE - Define New Project

Create a new project with all essential parameters.

### Project Information

**Basic Details**:

- Project name
- Client name (from CRM)
- Project description
- Project type (custom dev, product, support, consulting)
- Status (backlog, planning, in-progress, on-hold, completed)

**Timeline**:

- Start date
- Target completion date
- Estimated hours
- Actual hours (tracked as you work)

**Financial**:

- Contract value (revenue)
- Estimated cost (time * hourly rate)
- Expected profit (revenue - cost)
- Payment terms (upfront, milestone-based, post-completion)

**Deliverables**:

- List of specific deliverables
- Acceptance criteria for each
- Delivery date for each

**Goals Alignment**:

- Which business goal does this serve? (e.g., "Build $200K/year business")
- Which life goal? (e.g., "Financial Independence", "Career growth")
- Alignment score (0-100)

    └── Life Goal: Work-Life Balance
        └── Alignment: 7/10 (Fits in ~40 hrs/week for 5 weeks)
```

### Project Selection Criteria

Before accepting a project, evaluate:

**FINANCIAL CRITERIA**:

- Revenue: ≥$3K (minimum to be worth it)
- Profit margin: ≥40% (costs <60% of revenue)
- Hourly rate: ≥$75/hr ($35K / 200 hrs = $175/hr effective)
- Timeline: Realistic and achievable

**BUSINESS CRITERIA**:

- Supports business goal? (e.g., builds product, gets testimonial, etc.)
- Client quality? (Good communication, values your work)
- Potential for recurring revenue or referrals?
- Adds to portfolio or case study?

**LIFE GOAL CRITERIA**:

- Work hours: ≤40 hrs/week (doesn't overload)
- Project length: ≤3 months (doesn't drag on)
- Autonomy: ≥7/10 (you have decision-making power)
- Alignment: Serves your financial independence goal

**DECISION MATRIX**:

Rate each project on 5 dimensions (1-10 each):

1. **Profitability** (hours vs. revenue)
2. **Goal alignment** (business impact)
3. **Client quality** (communication, values)
4. **Work enjoyment** (interesting problem?)
5. **Life goal impact** (supports financial/career/balance goals)

**Total score** = Average of 5 dimensions

- 9-10: Strong YES (pursue immediately)
- 7-8: Good fit (discuss with client)
- 5-6: Moderate fit (only if no better projects)
- 3-4: Weak fit (pass or renegotiate)
- 1-2: Strong NO (decline)

Example:

```text
E-commerce Platform Redesign Evaluation
├── Profitability: 9/10 ($175/hr effective rate)
├── Goal alignment: 9/10 (Builds business, builds product)
├── Client quality: 8/10 (Good communication history)
├── Work enjoyment: 8/10 (Interesting technical problem)
└── Life goal impact: 7/10 (Good profit, fits time budget)

SCORE: 8.2/10 → STRONG YES - Pursue immediately
```
