4. Validation rules
5. Conditional logic (if any)

## Step 3: Progressive Data Collection

Execute the form section by section using **AskUserQuestion**:

### Section 1 Example (Company Information)

**Question**: "Let's start with your company information."

Present fields as a multi-question form:

- Company Name: [text input]
- Industry: [dropdown - auto-populate common industries]
- Company Size: [dropdown with clear options]
- Annual Revenue: [currency input with formatting]
- Website: [URL with validation]

**Validation Rules**:

- Company Name: 2-100 characters, no special characters
- Industry: Must select from list or enter "Other"
- Website: Valid URL format (auto-add https:// if missing)
- All required fields must have values

**Progressive Disclosure**:

- If Company Size is "1-10": Skip revenue question (likely not disclosed)
- If Industry is "Healthcare": Add HIPAA compliance question
- If Website provided: Auto-lookup company info (enrichment)

### Section 2 Example (Contact Information)

**Question**: "Now let's get your contact details."

**Smart Features**:

- Email validation: Check format, suggest corrections
- Phone formatting: Auto-format based on country
- LinkedIn: Extract name/title if URL provided (enrichment)
- Job Title: Suggest based on industry and seniority keywords

**Data Enrichment**:
If email domain matches website:

```text
✓ Email verified: Matches company website
✓ Auto-populated: Job title from LinkedIn
✓ Suggested: Contact preferences based on role
```

### Section 3 Example (Conditional Logic)

Based on previous answers, adapt questions:

```text
IF Budget_Range = "Under $10K":
  → Skip questions about enterprise features
  → Add question about DIY vs. managed service
  → Adjust timeline expectations

IF Decision_Maker = "No":
  → Add question: "Who is the decision maker?"
  → Add question: "How can we reach them?"
  → Adjust lead score accordingly

IF Industry = "Healthcare":
  → Add HIPAA compliance requirements
  → Add security questionnaire
  → Route to healthcare specialist
```

## Step 4: Real-Time Validation & Feedback

As data is collected, provide immediate feedback:

```text

✓ Company Name: "Acme Corp" - Valid
✓ Industry: "Software/SaaS" - Valid
⚠ Company Size: Please select a range
✗ Website: "acme" - Invalid URL format

✓ Phone: +1 (555) 123-4567 - Auto-formatted
✓ LinkedIn: Profile found & validated

PROGRESS: 67% complete (2 of 3 sections)
