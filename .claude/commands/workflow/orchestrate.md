Orchestrate sophisticated multi-agent workflows with dependencies, parallel execution, error handling, and approval gates.

## What This Command Does

This command creates and executes complex workflows that:

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate multiple AI agents working together
- **Dependency Management**: Handle sequential and parallel task execution
- **State Management**: Track workflow state across multiple steps
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry, rollback, and recovery strategies
- **Approval Gates**: Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical decisions
- **Context Sharing**: Pass data between workflow steps seamlessly
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into workflow execution
- **Template Library**: Pre-built workflows for common scenarios

Ideal for: Complex business processes, multi-system integrations, automated campaigns, deployment pipelines, and any scenario requiring coordinated multi-step automation.

## Workflow to Orchestrate

**Workflow**: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Identify Workflow Type

If $ARGUMENTS provided, load that workflow template.
If not provided or "custom", use **AskUserQuestion** to select:

**Question**: "What type of workflow would you like to orchestrate?"

**Options**:

1. **"Lead-to-Customer Pipeline"** - Complete sales workflow
   - Description: Qualification → CRM → Email → Follow-up → Deal creation

2. **"Content Publishing Pipeline"** - Multi-channel content distribution
   - Description: Write → Review → Approve → Publish → Promote → Analyze

3. **"Deployment Pipeline"** - Production deployment workflow
   - Description: Test → Build → Approve → Deploy → Verify → Monitor

4. **"Customer Onboarding"** - End-to-end customer activation
   - Description: Signup → Verify → Setup → Train → Success check

5. **"Custom Workflow"** - Build from scratch
   - Description: Define your own multi-step workflow with dependencies

Save to: `/home/webemo-aaron/projects/prompt-blueprint/.workflow/executions/WF-12345.json`

## Step 5: Execute Workflow Stages

### Stage Execution Loop

For each stage in dependency order:

1. **Check Dependencies**:

   ```yaml
   STAGE: enrich_data
   DEPENDENCIES: [collect_data]

   Checking dependencies...
   ✓ collect_data: COMPLETED

   All dependencies satisfied. Proceeding...
   ```

2. **Execute Stage**:

   ```text
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   STAGE 2/8: Enrich Lead Data
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Agent: data-enrichment-agent
   Status: RUNNING
   Started: 10:05:23
   Timeout: 5 minutes

   [Agent output streams here...]

   ✓ Company data enriched
   ✓ Contact information verified
   ✓ Social profiles found

   Status: COMPLETED
   Duration: 47 seconds
   Outputs: enriched_data, company_profile

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ```

3. **Handle Parallel Stages**:

   ```text
   PARALLEL EXECUTION GROUP: data_processing

   Running in parallel:
   → Stage 2: enrich_data [RUNNING] 47s
   → Stage 3: score_lead [RUNNING] 23s

   Waiting for all to complete...

   ✓ Stage 2: enrich_data [COMPLETED] 47s
   ✓ Stage 3: score_lead [COMPLETED] 56s

   Parallel group completed in 56 seconds
   ```

4. **Handle Approval Gates**:

   ```text
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ⏸ APPROVAL REQUIRED
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   STAGE 4/8: Create Zoho CRM Lead

   OPERATION PREVIEW:

   Lead Data:

   This operation will create a new lead in Zoho CRM.

   Approval request saved: PENDING-67890

   NEXT STEP:
   Review and approve this operation using:
   /workflow:approve PENDING-67890

   Workflow paused. Will resume after approval.
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ```

5. **Wait for Approval**:

   ```text
   WORKFLOW STATUS: Waiting for Approval

   Stage: create_crm_lead
   Pending Since: 10:06:12 (2 minutes ago)
   Timeout: 24 hours
   Approval ID: PENDING-67890

   The workflow will automatically resume after approval.
   You can check status with: /workflow:orchestrate status WF-12345
   ```

6. **Resume After Approval**:

   ```text
   ✓ APPROVAL GRANTED

   Approval ID: PENDING-67890
   Approved By: user@example.com
   Approved At: 10:08:45
   Wait Time: 2 minutes 33 seconds

   Resuming workflow execution...

   Executing stage: create_crm_lead
   [Agent execution continues...]
   ```

7. **Handle Stage Failures**:

   ```text
   ✗ STAGE FAILED: send_welcome_email

   Error: SMTP connection timeout
   Attempt: 1 of 3
   Retry Policy: Exponential backoff

   Retrying in 30 seconds...

   [Retry attempt 2...]
   ✓ RETRY SUCCESSFUL

   Stage completed after 2 attempts
   ```

8. **Update Progress**:

## Step 7: Error Handling & Recovery

### Workflow Failure Handling

If critical failure occurs:

```text
✗ WORKFLOW FAILED

Stage: create_crm_lead
Error: API authentication failed
Impact: CRITICAL (workflow cannot continue)

ERROR DETAILS:
- Error Code: AUTH_001
- Message: Invalid API credentials
- Timestamp: 2025-11-25 10:06:45
- Retry Attempts: 3 (all failed)

ROLLBACK INITIATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Rolling back completed stages:
✓ Enrich Data: No rollback needed (read-only)
✓ Score Lead: No rollback needed (read-only)

Notifying team...
✓ Email sent to: ops-team@company.com
✓ Slack alert posted to: #alerts

WORKFLOW STATUS: FAILED
Duration: 8 minutes 12 seconds
Completed Stages: 3/8

RECOVERY OPTIONS:

1. Fix authentication and retry workflow
   → Update API credentials
   → Run: /workflow:orchestrate resume WF-12345

2. Manual intervention required
   → Review error log: /workflow/logs/WF-12345-error.log
   → Contact support if needed

3. Abort workflow permanently
   → Run: /workflow:orchestrate abort WF-12345

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Non-Critical Failure Handling

For stages with `on_failure: "continue"`:

```text
⚠ STAGE FAILED (Non-Critical)

Stage: enrich_data
Error: External API unavailable
Impact: LOW (workflow can continue)

Action: Continuing workflow without enrichment data
Note: Manual enrichment can be done later

Workflow continuing with next stage...
```

## Step 8: Workflow Management Commands

### Status Check

```bash
/workflow:orchestrate status WF-12345
```

Shows current workflow status, progress, and outputs.

### Pause/Resume

```bash
# Pause running workflow
/workflow:orchestrate pause WF-12345

# Resume paused workflow
/workflow:orchestrate resume WF-12345
```

### Cancel/Abort

```bash
# Cancel with rollback
/workflow:orchestrate cancel WF-12345 --rollback

# Abort without rollback
/workflow:orchestrate abort WF-12345
```

### View History

```bash
# List all workflow executions
/workflow:orchestrate history

# Filter by status
/workflow:orchestrate history --status completed
/workflow:orchestrate history --status failed
```
