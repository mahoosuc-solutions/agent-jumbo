# /spec-kit:tasks - Generate Task Breakdown

Generate comprehensive task breakdown from implementation plan with time estimates, dependencies, priority levels, and export to project management tools.

## Overview

The `tasks` command transforms implementation plans into actionable work items:

- **Task List**: Granular, assignable tasks
- **Time Estimates**: Story points and hour estimates
- **Dependencies**: Task sequencing and prerequisites
- **Priority Levels**: Critical path identification
- **Export Formats**: Markdown, JIRA CSV, GitHub JSON, Linear import
- **Resource Allocation**: Skill-based task assignment

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Implementation plan must exist

- Run `/spec-kit:plan <design-id>` before tasks
- Workflow must be in 'tasks' phase or later

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Plan Exists

Check workflow status:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/{design_id}/workflow
```

Verify current phase:

- ❌ If phase = 'specify' or earlier → Must complete plan first
- ✅ If phase = 'tasks' → Proceed
- ✅ If phase = 'complete' → Can regenerate tasks

If plan doesn't exist:

```text
❌ No implementation plan found for design {design_id}

Current workflow phase: {current_phase}
Required phase: tasks

Generate plan first:
  /spec-kit:plan {design_id}
```

### Step 2: Configure Task Generation

**Ask user for task breakdown preferences:**

**2.1 Granularity Level**
Ask: "What level of task detail?"

- **High-level** (10-20 tasks) - Feature-level tasks
- **Medium** (30-50 tasks) - Component-level tasks (recommended)
- **Detailed** (80-150 tasks) - Function/file-level tasks

**2.2 Estimation Method**
Ask: "How should tasks be estimated?"

- **Story Points** (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- **Hours** (0.5h to 40h)
- **Both** (Story points + hours)
- **None** (no estimates)

**2.3 Team Size**
Ask: "How many developers on the team?" (1-10)

- Used for parallel task assignment
- Identifies critical path

**2.4 Sprint Planning**
Ask: "Plan tasks into sprints?" (Yes/No)
If Yes:

- Sprint duration (1 week / 2 weeks / custom)
- Team velocity (story points per sprint)

### Step 3: Generate Tasks via API

Call the task generation endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/{design_id}/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

The API will:

1. Load plan artifact from workspace
2. Call spec-kit CLI to generate tasks
3. Parse task breakdown
4. Store in workflow (100% complete)
5. Mark workflow as complete
6. Return tasks with metadata

### Step 4: Display Task Breakdown

Show comprehensive task list:

```text
✅ Task Breakdown Generated!

Design ID: {design_id}
Workflow Status: Complete (100%)
Generation Time: {execution_time_ms}ms

```yaml
User: /spec-kit:tasks design-def-456 --critical-path
Assistant: Critical Path (18 tasks, 120 hours):
  1. TASK-001: Initialize backend (4h)
  2. TASK-002: Database schema (3h)
  3. TASK-003: Docker setup (6h)

  18. TASK-062: CI/CD pipeline (6h)
```

### Example 3: Detailed Breakdown

```yaml
User: /spec-kit:tasks design-ghi-789
Assistant: What level of detail? (high-level/medium/detailed)
User: detailed
Assistant: Generating 142 detailed tasks...
Assistant: ✅ Task breakdown complete!
  Tasks: 142
  Average task size: 1.7 hours
  Ready for assignment
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Task breakdown generated with all tasks
✅ Time estimates provided
✅ Dependencies identified
✅ Critical path calculated
✅ Export format generated
✅ Workflow marked as complete (100%)
✅ Team ready to start implementation

## Notes

- Tasks can be exported to multiple formats
- Critical path helps identify bottlenecks
- Sprint planning aids in resource allocation
- Dependency graph ensures correct sequencing
- Tasks are versioned in the database
- Use tasks as source of truth during development
