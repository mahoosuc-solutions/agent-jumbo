# /spec-kit:specify - Generate Detailed Specifications

Generate comprehensive specifications from design requirements with user stories, functional requirements, and multi-format API contracts.

## Overview

The `specify` command transforms high-level requirements into detailed specifications:

- **User Stories**: As a / I want / So that format
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed feature specifications
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
- **API Contracts**: OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL, or Protobuf
- **Validation**: Automatic compliance checking

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Design or Create New

**Ask:** "Do you want to specify an existing design or create a new one?"

**Option A: Existing Design**

- Ask for design ID
- Fetch design from database
- Load existing requirements

**Option B: New Design**

- Create design first using `/design:solution`
- Then run specify on the new design

### Step 2: Load Design and Workflow

Fetch the design specification:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/design/specifications/{design_id}
```

Check if spec-kit workflow exists:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/{design_id}/workflow
```

If no workflow exists, ask: "Would you like to start with a constitution?" (Yes/No)

If Yes:

- Run `/spec-kit:constitution` first
- Create design with constitution
- Initialize workflow

If No:

- Initialize workflow without constitution

### Step 3: Gather Requirements (Interactive Mode)

**3.1 Problem Definition**
Ask: "What problem does this solve?" (1-2 sentences)

**3.2 User Stories** (3-10 stories)
Ask: "Let's create user stories. How many user stories do you need?" (3-10)

For each user story, collect in format:

```text
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [benefit]
```

Example:

```text
As a customer
I want to search for products by category
So that I can find items I'm interested in quickly
```

**3.3 Functional Requirements**
Ask: "What are the functional requirements?" (API endpoints, features, data models)

Collect:

- API endpoints needed (e.g., GET /products, POST /orders)
- Data models (e.g., User, Product, Order)
- Business rules (e.g., "Orders over $100 get free shipping")
- Integration points (e.g., "Integrate with Stripe for payments")

**3.4 Non-Functional Requirements**
Ask: "What are the non-functional requirements?"

Collect:

- Performance targets (e.g., "API response time <500ms")
- Scalability needs (e.g., "Support 10,000 concurrent users")
- Security requirements (e.g., "OAuth 2.0 authentication")
- Availability targets (e.g., "99.9% uptime")
- Compliance needs (e.g., "GDPR compliant")

**3.5 Choose Output Format**
Ask: "Which specification format would you like?" (can choose multiple)

Options:

1. **OpenAPI 3.0** - RESTful APIs with Swagger documentation
2. **AsyncAPI 2.6** - Event-driven/async messaging APIs
3. **GraphQL** - GraphQL schema with queries and mutations
4. **Protobuf** - Protocol Buffer definitions for gRPC
5. **All formats** - Generate all four formats

### Step 4: Generate Specification via API

Call the specifications API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/{design_id}/spec \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "format": "{selected_format}",
    "include_validation": true
  }'
```

The API will:

1. Build specification input from design requirements
2. Call spec-kit CLI to generate specification
3. Store artifacts in database
4. Advance workflow to 'plan' phase
5. Run validation if requested
6. Return specification with artifacts

### Step 5: Display Specification Summary

Show a comprehensive summary:

```text
✅ Specification Generated Successfully!

Design ID: {design_id}
Workflow ID: {workflow_id}
Current Phase: Specify → Plan
Progress: 60%

### Step 6: Optional Actions

Ask if the user wants to:
- **Generate implementation plan** - Move to plan phase
- **Run validation** - Clarify or analyze the specification
- **Export to file** - Save specification artifacts
- **Generate additional formats** - Create other spec formats
- **Link to constitution** - Validate against governance

## Advanced Features

### Generate All Formats
```bash
/spec-kit:specify <design-id> --all-formats
```

Generates OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL, and Protobuf simultaneously.

API call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/formats/generate-all \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"design_id": "{design_id}"}'
```

### Validate Specification

```bash
/spec-kit:specify <design-id> --validate
```

Runs validation to find:

- Underspecified requirements (clarify mode)
- Inconsistencies (analyze mode)
- Missing elements

### Export to File

```bash
/spec-kit:specify <design-id> --export <path>
```

Exports all specification artifacts to directory.

API call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/formats/export \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "specification": {spec_object},
    "format": "openapi",
    "export_path": "{path}/specification.yaml"
  }'
```

### View Workflow Status

```bash
/spec-kit:specify <design-id> --status
```

Shows current workflow phase and completion percentage.

API call:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/specifications/designs/{design_id}/workflow
```

## Constitution Compliance

If design has linked constitution:

1. Automatically validate specification against constitution
2. Check for constraint violations
3. Verify preferred stack usage
4. Report compliance score (0-100)

Display compliance results:

```text
🔒 Constitution Compliance Check

Constitution: SaaS Best Practices (const-abc-123)
Compliance Score: 85/100

✓ Passed Checks (12):
  ✓ All APIs use authentication (OAuth 2.0)
  ✓ Rate limiting specified (1000 req/hour)
  ✓ Error handling follows standard format
  ✓ All endpoints documented in OpenAPI
  [... more ...]

⚠ Warnings (3):
  ⚠ Multi-tenancy isolation not explicitly mentioned
  ⚠ Scalability target below recommended (10k vs 50k users)
  ⚠ Using MySQL instead of preferred PostgreSQL

❌ Violations (1):
  ❌ No encryption specified for data at rest

Recommendations:
1. Add explicit tenant isolation mechanism
2. Consider increasing scalability target
3. Implement data encryption (AES-256)
4. Evaluate PostgreSQL for better JSON support
```

3. design-ghi-789: Analytics Dashboard

Try: /spec-kit:specify <design-id>
Or create new design: /design:solution "New Project"
```

**If workflow not initialized:**

```text
⚠️ No spec-kit workflow found for this design.

Would you like to:
1. Start with constitution (recommended)
2. Start without constitution

[User selects option]
```

**If validation fails:**

```text
⚠️ Specification validation found issues:

Errors (2):
1. Missing required field: info.title
2. Invalid OpenAPI version: must be 3.x

Warnings (1):
1. No paths defined in specification

Fix these issues and try again, or continue anyway? (fix/continue)
```
